And God created man to his own image : to the image of God he created him : male and female he created them .
And God blessed them , saying : <unk> and multiply , and fill the earth , and subdue it , and rule over the fishes of the sea , and the fowls of the air , and all living creatures that move upon the earth .
<unk> and multiply ....
This is not a precept , as some <unk> <unk> would have it , but a blessing , rendering them fruitful ; for God had said the same words to the fishes , and birds , ( ver .
22 ) who were <unk> of receiving a precept .
And God said : Behold I have given you every herb bearing seed upon the earth , and all trees that have in themselves seed of their own kind , to be your meat :
And to all beasts of the earth , and to every fowl of the air , and to all that move upon the earth , and wherein there is life , that they may have to feed upon .
And it was so done .
And God saw all the things that he had made , and they were very good .
And the evening and morning were the sixth day .
Genesis Chapter 2 God <unk> on the seventh day and blesseth it .
The earthly paradise , in which God <unk> man .
He commandeth him not to eat of the tree of knowledge .
And <unk> a woman of his <unk> .
So the heavens and the earth were finished , and all the furniture of them .
And on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made : and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had done .
He rested , etc .... That is , he ceased to make or create any new kinds of things .
Though , as our Lord tells us , John <unk> , “ He still worketh ” , viz . , by <unk> and <unk> all things , and <unk> souls .
And he blessed the seventh day , and sanctified it : because in it he had rested from all his work which God created and made .
These are the generations of the heaven and the earth , when they were created , in the day that the Lord God made the heaven and the earth :
And every plant of the field before it sprung up in the earth , and every herb of the ground before it grew : for the Lord God had not rained upon the earth ; and there was not a man to till the earth .
But a spring rose out of the earth , <unk> all the <unk> of the earth .
And the Lord God formed man of the <unk> of the earth : and <unk> into his face the breath of life , and man became a living soul .
And the Lord God had planted a paradise of pleasure from the beginning : wherein he placed man whom he had formed .
And the Lord God brought forth of the ground all manner of trees , fair to behold , and pleasant to eat of : the tree of life also in the midst of paradise : and the tree of knowledge of good and evil .
The tree of life ....
So called because it had that <unk> , that by eating of the fruit of it , man would have been preserved in a constant state of health , <unk> , and strength , and would not have died at all .
The tree of knowledge .... To which the deceitful serpent falsely <unk> the power of <unk> a <unk> kind of knowledge , beyond that which God was pleased to give .
And a river went out of the place of pleasure to water paradise , which from thence is divided into four heads .
The name of the one is <unk> : that is it which <unk> all the land of <unk> , where gold groweth .
And the gold of that land is very good : there is found <unk> , and the onyx stone .
And the name of the second river is <unk> : the same is it that <unk> all the land of Ethiopia .
And the name of the third river is <unk> : the same passeth along by the Assyrians .
And the fourth river is Euphrates .
And the Lord God took man , and put him into the paradise of pleasure , to dress it , and to keep it .
And he commanded him , saying : Of every tree of paradise thou shalt eat :
But of the tree of knowledge of good and evil , thou shalt not eat .
For in what day soever thou shalt eat of it , thou shalt die the death .
And the Lord God said : It is not good for man to be alone : let us make him a help like unto himself .
And the Lord God having formed out of the ground all the beasts of the earth , and all the fowls of the air , brought them to Adam to see what he would call them : for whatsoever Adam called any living creature the same is its name .
And Adam called all the beasts by their names , and all the fowls of the air , and all the cattle of the field : but for Adam there was not found a helper like himself .
Then the Lord God cast a deep sleep upon Adam : and when he was fast asleep , he took one of his <unk> , and filled up flesh for it .
And the Lord God built the <unk> which he took from Adam into a woman : and brought her to Adam .
And Adam said : This now is bone of my bones , and flesh of my flesh ; she shall be called woman , because she was taken out of man .
Wherefore a man shall leave father and mother , and shall cleave to his wife : and they shall be two in one flesh .
And they were both naked : to wit , Adam and his wife : and were not ashamed .
Genesis Chapter 3 The serpent ’ s <unk> .
The fall of our first parents .
Their punishment .
The promise of a Redeemer .
Now the serpent was more <unk> than any of the beasts of the earth which the Lord God had made .
And he said to the woman : Why hath God commanded you , that you should not eat of every tree of paradise ?
And the woman answered him , saying : Of the fruit of the trees that are in paradise we do eat :
But of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of paradise , God hath commanded us that we should not eat ; and that we should not touch it , lest perhaps we die .
And the serpent said to the woman : No , you shall not die the death .
For God doth know that in what day soever you shall eat thereof , your eyes shall be opened : and you shall be as Gods , knowing good and evil .
And the woman saw that the tree was good to eat , and fair to the eyes , and delightful to behold : and she took of the fruit thereof , and did eat , and gave to her husband , who did eat .
And the eyes of them both were opened : and when they perceived themselves to be naked , they <unk> together fig leaves , and made themselves <unk> .
And the eyes , etc .... Not that they were blind before , ( for the woman saw that the tree was fair to the eyes , ver .
6 . )
nor yet that their eyes were opened to any more perfect knowledge of good ; but only to the unhappy experience of having lost the good of original grace and innocence , and <unk> the dreadful evil of sin .
From whence followed a shame of their being naked ; which they minded not before ; because being now <unk> of original grace , they quickly began to be subject to the shameful <unk> of the flesh .
And when they heard the voice of the Lord God walking in paradise at the <unk> air , Adam and his wife hid themselves from the face of the Lord God , <unk> the trees of paradise .
And the Lord God called Adam , and said to him : Where art thou ?
And he said : I heard thy voice in paradise ; and I was afraid , because I was naked , and I hid myself .
And he said to him : And who hath told thee that thou wast naked , but that thou hast eaten of the tree whereof I commanded thee that thou shouldst not eat ?
And Adam said : The woman , whom thou gavest me to be my companion , gave me of the tree , and I did eat .
And the Lord God said to the woman : Why hast thou done this ?
And she answered : The serpent deceived me , and I did eat .
And the Lord God said to the serpent : Because thou hast done this thing , thou art cursed among all cattle , and beasts of the earth : upon thy breast shalt thou go , and earth shalt thou eat all the days of thy life .
I will put <unk> between thee and the woman , and thy seed and her seed : she shall crush thy head , and thou shalt lie in wait for her <unk> .
She shall crush .... <unk> , the woman ; so divers of the fathers read this place , <unk> to the Latin : others read it <unk> , viz . , the seed .
The sense is the same : for it is by her seed , Jesus Christ , that the woman <unk> the serpent ’ s head .
To the woman also he said : I will multiply thy sorrows , and thy <unk> : in sorrow shalt thou bring forth children , and thou shalt be under thy husband ’ s power , and he shall have dominion over thee .
And to Adam he said : Because thou hast hearkened to the voice of thy wife , and hast eaten of the tree , whereof I commanded thee , that thou shouldst not eat , cursed is the earth in thy work : with labour and <unk> shalt thou eat thereof all the days of thy life .
<unk> and <unk> shall it bring forth to thee , and thou shalt eat the herbs of the earth .
In the <unk> of thy face shalt thou eat bread till thou return to the earth out of which thou wast taken : for dust thou art , and into dust thou shalt return .
And Adam called the name of his wife <unk> : because she was the mother of all the living .
And the Lord God made for Adam and his wife garments of skins , and clothed them .
And he said : Behold Adam is become as one of us , knowing good and evil : now therefore lest perhaps he put forth his hand and take also of the tree of life , and eat , and live for ever .
Behold Adam , etc ....
This was spoken by way of <unk> him with his pride , in <unk> a knowledge that might make him like to God .
And the Lord God sent him out of the paradise of pleasure , to till the earth from which he was taken .
And he cast out Adam : and placed before the paradise of pleasure <unk> , and a <unk> sword , turning every way , to keep the way of the tree of life .
Genesis Chapter 4 The history of Cain and Abel .
And Adam knew <unk> his wife ; who conceived and brought forth Cain , saying : I have gotten a man through God .
And again she brought forth his brother Abel .
And Abel was a shepherd , and Cain a husbandman .
And it came to pass after many days , that Cain offered , of the fruits of the earth , gifts to the Lord .
Abel also offered of the <unk> of his flock , and of their fat : and the Lord had respect to Abel , and to his offerings .
<unk> respect .... That is , shewed his <unk> of his sacrifice ( as coming from a heart full of <unk> ) : and that , as we may suppose , by some <unk> token , such as sending fire from heaven upon his offerings .
But to Cain and his offerings he had no respect : and Cain was exceeding angry , and his countenance fell .
And the Lord said to him : Why art thou angry ?
and why is thy countenance fallen ?
If thou do well , shalt thou not receive ?
but if ill , shall not sin forthwith be present at the door ?
but the lust thereof shall be under thee , and thou shalt have dominion over it .
And Cain said to Abel his brother : Let us go forth abroad .
And when they were in the field , Cain rose up against his brother Abel , and slew him .
And the Lord said to Cain : Where is thy brother Abel ?
And he answered : I know not : am I my brother ’ s keeper ?
And he said to him : What hast thou done ?
the voice of thy brother ’ s blood crieth to me from the earth .
Now , therefore , cursed shalt thou be upon the earth , which hath opened her mouth and received the blood of thy brother at thy hand .
When thou shalt till it , it shall not yield to thee its fruit : a fugitive and a <unk> shalt thou be upon the earth .
And Cain said to the Lord : My iniquity is greater than that I may deserve pardon .
Behold thou dost cast me out this day from the face of the earth , and from thy face I shall be hid , and I shall be a <unk> and a fugitive on the earth : every one , therefore , that findeth me , shall kill me .
Every one that findeth me shall kill me .... His guilty conscience made him fear his own <unk> and <unk> ; of whom , by this time , there might be a good number upon the earth ; which had now endured near <unk> years ; as may be gathered from Gen. <unk> , compared with chap .
<unk> , though in the <unk> account given in the scriptures , only Cain and Abel are mentioned .
And the Lord said to him : No , it shall not so be : but whosoever shall kill Cain , shall be punished sevenfold .
And the Lord set a mark upon Cain , that whosoever found him should not kill him .
Set a mark , etc ....
The more common opinion of the interpreters of holy writ <unk> this mark to have been a trembling of the body ; or a horror and <unk> in his countenance .
And Cain went out from the face of the Lord , and dwelt as a fugitive on the earth at the east side of <unk> .
And Cain knew his wife , and she conceived , and brought forth Henoch : and he built a city , and called the name thereof by the name of his son Henoch .
His wife .... She was a daughter of Adam , and Cain ’ s own sister ; God <unk> with such <unk> in the beginning of the world , as mankind could not otherwise be <unk> .
He built a city , viz ....
In <unk> of time , when his race was multiplied , so as to be numerous enough to people it .
For in the many hundred years he lived , his race might be multiplied even to <unk> .
And Henoch begot <unk> , and <unk> begot <unk> , and <unk> begot <unk> , and <unk> begot Lamech , 4 : 19 . Who took two wives : the name of the one was <unk> , and the name of the other <unk> .
And <unk> brought forth <unk> : who was the father of such as dwell in tents , and of <unk> .
And his brother ’ s name was <unk> : he was the father of them that play upon the harp and the <unk> .
<unk> also brought forth <unk> , who was a <unk> and <unk> in every work of brass and iron .
And the sister of <unk> was <unk> .
And Lamech said to his wives <unk> and <unk> : Hear my voice , ye wives of Lamech , hearken to my speech : for I have slain a man to the <unk> of myself , and a <unk> to my own <unk> .
I have slain a man , etc ....
It is the tradition of the Hebrews , that Lamech in <unk> slew Cain , <unk> him for a wild beast ; and that having discovered what he had done , he beat so <unk> the youth , by whom he was led into that <unk> , that he died of the <unk> .
<unk> vengeance shall be taken for Cain : but for Lamech seventy times sevenfold .
Adam also knew his wife again : and she brought forth a son , and called his name Seth , saying : God hath given me another seed for Abel , whom Cain slew .
But to Seth also was born a son , whom he called <unk> : this man began to call upon the name of the Lord .
<unk> to call upon , etc .... Not that Adam and Seth had not called upon God , before the birth of <unk> ; but that <unk> used more solemnity in the worship and <unk> of God .
Genesis Chapter 5 The genealogy , age , and death of the <unk> , from Adam to Noe .
The translation of Henoch .
This is the book of the generation of Adam .
In the day that God created man , he made him to the likeness of God .
He created them male and female ; and blessed them : and called their name Adam , in the day when they were created .
And Adam lived a hundred and thirty years , and begot a son to his own image and likeness , and called his name Seth .
And the days of Adam , after he begot Seth , were eight hundred years : and he begot sons and daughters .
And all the time that Adam lived , came to nine hundred and thirty years , and he died .
Seth also lived a hundred and five years , and begot <unk> .
And Seth lived after he begot <unk> , eight hundred and seven years , and begot sons and daughters .
And all the days of Seth were nine hundred and twelve years , and he died .
And <unk> lived ninety years , and begot <unk> .
After whose birth he lived eight hundred and fifteen years , and begot sons and daughters .
And all the days of <unk> were nine hundred and five years , and he died .
And <unk> lived seventy years , and begot <unk> .
And <unk> lived after he begot <unk> , eight hundred and forty years , and begot sons and daughters .
And all the days of <unk> were nine hundred and ten years , and he died .
And <unk> lived <unk> years and begot <unk> .
And <unk> lived after he begot <unk> , eight hundred and thirty years , and begot sons and daughters .
And all the days of <unk> were eight hundred and <unk> years , and he died .
And <unk> lived a hundred and <unk> years , and begot Henoch .
And <unk> lived after he begot Henoch , eight hundred years , and begot sons and daughters .
And all the days of <unk> were nine hundred and <unk> years , and he died .
And Henoch lived <unk> years , and begot <unk> .
And Henoch walked with God : and lived after he begot <unk> , three hundred years , and begot sons and daughters .
And all the days of Henoch were three hundred and <unk> years .
And he walked with God , and was seen no more : because God took him .
And <unk> lived a hundred and <unk> years , and begot Lamech .
And <unk> lived after he begot Lamech , seven hundred and <unk> years , and begot sons and daughters .
And all the days of <unk> were nine hundred and <unk> years , and he died .
And Lamech lived a hundred and <unk> years , and begot a son .
And he called his name Noe , saying : This same shall comfort us from the works and labours of our hands on the earth , which the Lord hath cursed .
And Lamech lived after he begot Noe , five hundred and <unk> years , and begot sons and daughters .
And all the days of Lamech came to seven hundred and <unk> years , and he died .
And Noe , when he was five hundred years old , begot Sem , Cham , and Japheth .
Genesis Chapter 6 Man ’ s sin is the cause of the <unk> .
Noe is commanded to build the ark .
And after that men began to be multiplied upon the earth , and daughters were born to them ,
The sons of God seeing the daughters of men , that they were fair , took to themselves wives of all which they chose .
The sons of God ....
The <unk> of Seth and <unk> are here called sons of God from their religion and piety : whereas the ungodly race of Cain , who by their carnal <unk> lay <unk> upon the earth , are called the children of men .
The unhappy consequence of the former <unk> with the latter , ought to be a <unk> to Christians to be very <unk> in their <unk> ; and not to suffer themselves to be determined in their choice by their carnal passion , to the <unk> of virtue or religion .
And God said : My spirit shall not remain in man for ever , because he is flesh , and his days shall be a hundred and twenty years .
His days shall be , etc ....
The meaning is , that man ’ s days , which before the flood were usually <unk> years , should now be reduced to <unk> years .
Or rather , that God would allow men this <unk> of <unk> years , for their repentance and conversion , before he would send the <unk> .
Now giants were upon the earth in those days .
For after the sons of God went in to the daughters of men , and they brought forth children , these are the mighty men of old , men of <unk> .
<unk> ....
It is <unk> the <unk> of men before the flood were of a <unk> stature in comparison with what men now are .
But these here spoken of are called giants , as being not only tall in stature , but violent and <unk> in their <unk> , and <unk> <unk> of <unk> and lust .
And God seeing that the wickedness of men was great on the earth , and that all the thought of their heart was bent upon evil at all times ,
It repented him that he had made man on the earth .
And being touched <unk> with sorrow of heart , It repented him , etc .... God , who is <unk> , is not <unk> of repentance , grief , or any other passion .
But these <unk> are used to declare the <unk> of the sins of men , which was so provoking as to <unk> their Creator to destroy these his creatures , whom before he had so much <unk> .
He said : I will destroy man , whom I have created , from the face of the earth , from man even to beasts , from the creeping thing even to the fowls of the air , for it <unk> me that I have made them .
But Noe found grace before the Lord .
These are the generations of Noe : Noe was a just and perfect man in his generations , he walked with God .
And he begot three sons , Sem , Cham , and Japheth .
And the earth was corrupted before God , and was filled with iniquity .
And when God had seen that the earth was corrupted ( for all flesh had corrupted its way upon the earth ) ,
He said to Noe : The end of all flesh is come before me , the earth is filled with iniquity through them , and I will destroy them with the earth .
Make thee an ark of timber <unk> : thou shalt make little <unk> in the ark , and thou shalt pitch it within and without .
And thus shalt thou make it .
The length of the ark shall be three hundred cubits : the breadth of it fifty cubits , and the height of it thirty cubits .
Three hundred cubits , etc ....
The ark , according to the <unk> here set down , contained four hundred and fifty thousand square cubits ; which was more than enough to contain all the kinds of living creatures , with all necessary provisions : even <unk> the cubits here spoken of to have been only a foot and a half each , which was the least kind of cubits .
Thou shalt make a window in the ark , and in a cubit shalt thou finish the top of it : and the door of the ark thou shalt set in the side : with lower , middle chambers , and third <unk> shalt thou make it .
Behold , I will bring the waters of a great flood upon the earth , to destroy all flesh , wherein is the breath of life under heaven .
All things that are in the earth shall be consumed .
And I will establish my covenant with thee , and thou shalt enter into the ark , thou and thy sons , and thy wife , and the wives of thy sons with thee .
And of every living creature of all flesh , thou shalt bring two of a sort into the ark , that they may live with thee : of the male sex , and the female .
Of fowls according to their kind , and of beasts in their kind , and of every thing that <unk> on the earth according to its kind : two of every sort shall go in with thee , that they may live .
Thou shalt take unto thee of all food that may be eaten , and thou shalt lay it up with thee : and it shall be food for thee and them .
And Noe did all things which God commanded him .
Genesis Chapter 7 Noe with his family go into the ark .
The <unk> <unk> the earth .
And the Lord said to him : Go in , thou and all thy house , into the ark : for thee I have seen just before me in this generation .
Of all clean beasts take seven and seven , the male and the female .
Of all clean ....
The distinction of clean and unclean beasts appears to have been made before the law of Moses , which was not <unk> till the year of the world <unk> .
But of the beasts that are unclean two and two , the male and the female .
Of the fowls also of the air seven and seven , the male and the female : that seed may be saved upon the face of the whole earth .
For yet a while , and after seven days , I will rain upon the earth forty days and forty nights : and I will destroy every substance that I have made , from the face of the earth .
And Noe did all things which the Lord had commanded him .
And he was six hundred years old , when the waters of the flood <unk> the earth .
And Noe went in and his sons , his wife and the wives of his sons with him into the ark , because of the waters of the flood .
And of beasts clean and unclean , and of fowls , and of every thing that <unk> upon the earth ,
Two and two went in to Noe into the ark , male and female , as the Lord had commanded Noe .
And after the seven days were passed , the waters of the flood <unk> the earth .
In the six <unk> year of the life of Noe , in the second month , in the <unk> day of the month , all the fountains of the great deep were broken up , and the <unk> of heaven were opened :
And the rain fell upon the earth forty days and forty nights .
In the selfsame day Noe , and Sem , and Cham , and Japheth , his sons : his wife , and the three wives of his sons with them , went into the ark .
They and every beast according to its kind , and all the cattle in their kind , and every thing that <unk> upon the earth , according to its kind , and every fowl according to its kind , all birds , and all that fly ,
<unk> in to Noe into the ark , two and two of all flesh , wherein was the breath of life .
And they that went in , went in male and female of all flesh , as God had commanded him : and the Lord shut him in on the outside .
And the flood was forty days upon the earth : and the waters increased , and lifted up the ark on high from the earth .
For they <unk> exceedingly : and filled all on the face of the earth : and the ark was carried upon the waters .
And the waters prevailed beyond measure upon the earth : and all the high mountains under the whole heaven were covered .
The water was fifteen cubits higher than the mountains which it covered .
And all flesh was destroyed that moved upon the earth , both of fowl and of cattle , and of beasts , and of all creeping things that <unk> upon the earth : and all men .
And all things wherein there is the breath of life on the earth , died .
And he destroyed all the substance that was upon the earth , from man even to beast , and the creeping things and fowls of the air : and they were destroyed from the earth : and Noe only remained , and they that were with him in the ark .
And the waters prevailed upon the earth a hundred and fifty days .
Genesis Chapter 8 The <unk> <unk> .
Noe goeth out of the ark , and offereth a sacrifice .
God ’ s covenant to him .
And God remembered Noe , and all the living creatures , and all the cattle which were with him in the ark , and brought a wind upon the earth , and the waters were <unk> :
The fountains also of the deep , and the <unk> of heaven , were shut up , and the rain from heaven was <unk> .
And the waters returned from off the earth going and coming : and they began to be <unk> after a hundred and fifty days .
And the ark rested in the seventh month , the seven and twentieth day of the month , upon the mountains of <unk> .
And the waters were going and <unk> until the tenth month : for in the tenth month , the first day of the month , the tops of the mountains appeared .
And after that forty days were passed , Noe opening the window of the ark , which he had made , sent forth a raven :
Which went forth and did not return , till the waters were dried up upon the earth .
Did not return ....
The raven did not return into the ark ; but ( as it may be gathered from the Hebrew ) went to and fro ; sometimes going to the mountains , where it found carcasses to feed on : and other times returning , to rest upon the top of the ark .
He sent forth also a dove after him , to see if the waters had now ceased upon the face of the earth .
But she not finding where her foot might rest , returned to him into the ark : for the waters were upon the whole earth : and he put forth his hand , and caught her , and brought her into the ark .
And having waited yet seven other days , he again sent forth the dove out of the ark .
And she came to him in the evening carrying a <unk> of an olive tree , with green leaves , in her mouth .
Noe therefore understood that the waters were ceased upon the earth .
And he stayed yet other seven days : and he sent forth the dove , which returned not any more unto him .
Therefore in the six <unk> and first year , the first month , the first day of the month , the waters were <unk> upon the earth , and Noe opening the covering of the ark , looked , and saw that the face of the earth was dried .
In the second month , the seven and twentieth day of the month , the earth was dried .
And God spoke to Noe , saying :
Go out of the ark , thou and thy wife , thy sons and the wives of thy sons with thee .
All living things that are with thee of all flesh , as well in fowls as in beasts , and all creeping things that <unk> upon the earth , bring out with thee , and go ye upon the earth : increase and multiply upon it .
So Noe went out , he and his sons : his wife , and the wives of his sons with him .
And all living things , and cattle , and creeping things that <unk> upon the earth , according to their kinds went out of the ark .
And Noe built an altar unto the Lord : and taking of all cattle and fowls that were clean , offered holocausts upon the altar .
<unk> , ... or whole burnt offerings .
In which the whole victim was consumed by fire upon God ’ s altar , and no part was reserved for the use of priest or people .
And the Lord <unk> a sweet savour , and said : I will no more curse the earth for the sake of man : for the <unk> and thought of man ’ s heart are <unk> to evil from his youth : therefore I will no more destroy every living soul as I have done .
<unk> , etc .... A <unk> <unk> , <unk> that God was well pleased with the sacrifices which his servant offered .
All the days of the earth , <unk> and harvest , cold and heat , summer and winter , night and day , shall not cease .
Genesis Chapter 9 God blesseth Noe : <unk> blood , and promiseth never more to destroy the world by water .
The blessing of Sem and Japheth .
And God blessed Noe and his sons .
And he said to them : <unk> , and multiply , and fill the earth .
And let the fear and dread of you be upon all the beasts of the earth , and upon all the fowls of the air , and all that move upon the earth : all the fishes of the sea are delivered into your hand .
And every thing that <unk> , and liveth shall be meat for you : even as the green herbs have I delivered them all to you :
<unk> that flesh with blood you shall not eat .
For I will require the blood of your lives at the hand of every beast , and at the hand of man , at the hand of every man , and of his brother , will I require the life of man .
Whosoever shall shed man ’ s blood , his blood shall be shed : for man was made to the image of God .
But increase you and multiply , and go upon the earth and fill it .
Thus also said God to Noe , and to his sons with him :
Behold I will establish my covenant with you , and with your seed after you :
And with every living soul that is with you , as well in all birds , as in cattle and beasts of the earth , that are come forth out of the ark , and in all the beasts of the earth .
I will establish my covenant with you , and all flesh shall be no more destroyed with the waters of a flood , neither shall there be from henceforth a flood to waste the earth .
And God said : This is the sign of the covenant which I give between me and you , and to every living soul that is with you , for perpetual generations .
I will set my bow in the clouds , and it shall be the sign of a covenant between me and between the earth .
And when I shall cover the sky with clouds , my bow shall appear in the clouds :
And I will remember my covenant with you , and with every living soul that beareth flesh : and there shall no more be waters of a flood to destroy all flesh .
And the bow shall be in the clouds , and I shall see it , and shall remember the everlasting covenant , that was made between God and every living soul of all flesh which is upon the earth .
And God said to Noe : This shall be the sign of the covenant , which I have established , between me and all flesh upon the earth .
And the sons of Noe , who came out of the ark , were Sem , Cham , and Japheth : and Cham is the father of Chanaan .
These three are the sons of Noe : and from these was all mankind spread over the whole earth .
And Noe a husbandman began to till the ground , and planted a vineyard .
And drinking of the wine was made drunk , and was <unk> in his tent .
<unk> .... Noe by the judgment of the fathers was not guilty of sin , in being overcome by wine : because he knew not the strength of it .
Which when Cham the father of Chanaan had seen , to wit , that his father ’ s nakedness was <unk> , he told it to his two brethren without .
But Sem and Japheth put a cloak upon their shoulders , and going backward , covered the nakedness of their father : and their faces were turned away , and they saw not their father ’ s nakedness .
<unk> the nakedness ....
Thus , as St. <unk> takes notice <unk> 35 ; <unk> .
c . 22 , we ought to cover the nakedness , that is , the sins , of our spiritual parents and <unk> .
And Noe <unk> from the wine , when he had learned what his younger son had done to him ,
He said : Cursed be Chanaan , a servant of servants shall he be unto his brethren .
Cursed be Chanaan ....
The curses , as well as the blessings , of the <unk> , were <unk> : And this in particular is here recorded by Moses , for the children of Israel , who were to possess the land of Chanaan .
But why should Chanaan be cursed for his father ’ s <unk> ?
The Hebrews answer , that he being then a boy , was the first that saw his <unk> ’ s nakedness , and told his father Cham of it ; and joined with him in <unk> at it : which drew upon him , rather than upon the rest of the children of Cham , this <unk> curse .
And he said : Blessed be the Lord God of Sem , be Chanaan his servant .
May God <unk> Japheth , and may he dwell in the tents of Sem , and Chanaan be his servant .
And Noe lived after the flood three hundred and fifty years .
And all his days were in the whole nine hundred and fifty years : and he died .
Genesis Chapter 10 The genealogy of the children of Noe , by whom the world was <unk> after the flood .
These are the generations of the sons of Noe : Sem , Cham , and Japheth : and unto them sons were born after the flood .
The sons of Japheth : <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> .
And the sons of <unk> : <unk> and <unk> and <unk> .
And the sons of <unk> : <unk> and Tharsis , <unk> and <unk> .
By these were divided the islands of the Gentiles in their lands , every one according to his tongue and their families in their nations .
The islands ....
So the Hebrews called all the <unk> countries , to which they went by ships from Judea , to Greece , Italy , <unk> , etc .
And the <unk> of Cham : <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> , and Chanaan .
And the sons of <unk> : Saba , and <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> .
The sons of <unk> : Saba , and <unk> .
Now <unk> begot <unk> : he began to be mighty on the earth .
And he was a stout <unk> before the Lord .
<unk> came a proverb : Even as <unk> the stout <unk> before the Lord .
A stout <unk> .... Not of beasts but of men : whom by violence and <unk> he brought under his dominion .
And such he was , not only in the opinion of men , but before the Lord , that is , in his sight who cannot be deceived .
And the beginning of his kingdom was Babylon , and <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> in the land of <unk> .
Out of that land came forth <unk> , and built Ninive , and the streets of the city , and <unk> .
<unk> also between Ninive and <unk> : this is the great city .
And <unk> begot <unk> , and <unk> and <unk> , <unk> .
And <unk> , and <unk> ; of whom came forth the Philistines , and the <unk> .
And Chanaan begot Sidon his firstborn , the Hethite ,
And the Jebusite , and the Amorrhite , and the <unk> .
The Hevite and <unk> : the <unk> ,
And the <unk> , the <unk> , and the <unk> : and afterwards the families of the Chanaanites were spread abroad .
And the limits of Chanaan were from Sidon as one comes to Gerara even to Gaza , until thou enter Sodom and Gomorrha , and <unk> , and <unk> even to <unk> .
These are the children of Cham in their kindreds and tongues , and generations , and lands , and nations .
Of Sem also the father of all the children of Heber , the elder brother of Japheth , sons were born .
The sons of Sem : Elam and <unk> , and Arphaxad , and <unk> , and Aram .
The sons of Aram : <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> ; and <unk> .
But Arphaxad begot <unk> , of whom was born Heber .
And to Heber were born two sons : the name of the one was <unk> , because in his days was the earth divided : and his brother ’ s name <unk> .
Which <unk> begot <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> , <unk> ,
And <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> ,
And <unk> , and <unk> , Saba ,
And Ophir , and <unk> , and Jobab .
All these were the sons of <unk> .
And their dwelling was from <unk> as we go on as far as <unk> , a mountain in the east .
These are the children of Sem according to their kindreds and tongues , and countries in their nations .
These are the families of Noe , according to their people and nations .
By these were the nations divided on the earth after the flood .
Genesis Chapter 11 The tower of <unk> .
The confusion of tongues .
The genealogy of Sem down to Abram .
And the earth was of one tongue , and of the same speech .
And when they removed from the east , they found a plain in the land of <unk> , and dwelt in it .
And each one said to his neighbour : Come let us make brick , and <unk> them with fire .
And they had brick instead of stones , and <unk> instead of mortar :
And they said : Come , let us make a city and a tower , the top whereof may reach to heaven ; and let us make our name famous before we be scattered abroad into all lands .
And the Lord came down to see the city and the tower , which the children of Adam were building .
And he said : Behold , it is one people , and all have one tongue : and they have begun to do this , neither will they leave off from their designs , till they accomplish them in deed .
Come ye , therefore , let us go down , and there <unk> their tongue , that they may not understand one another ’ s speech .
And so the Lord scattered them from that place into all lands , and they ceased to build the city .
And therefore the name thereof was called <unk> , because there the language of the whole earth was confounded : and from thence the Lord scattered them abroad upon the face of all countries .
<unk> .... That is , confusion .
These are the generations of Sem : Sem was a hundred years old when he begot Arphaxad , two years after the flood .
And Sem lived after he begot Arphaxad , five hundred years , and begot sons and daughters .
And Arphaxad lived <unk> years , and begot <unk> .
And Arphaxad lived after he begot <unk> , three hundred and three years , and begot sons and daughters .
<unk> also lived thirty years , and begot Heber .
And <unk> lived after he begot Heber , four hundred and three years : and begot sons and daughters .
And Heber lived <unk> years , and begot <unk> .
And Heber lived after he begot <unk> , four hundred and thirty years : and begot sons and daughters .
<unk> also lived thirty years , and begot <unk> .
And <unk> lived after he begot <unk> , two hundred and nine years , and begot sons and daughters .
And <unk> lived thirty-two years , and begot <unk> .
And <unk> lived after he begot <unk> , two hundred and seven years , and begot sons and daughters .
And <unk> lived thirty years , and begot Nachor .
And <unk> lived after he begot Nachor , two hundred years , and begot sons and daughters .
And Nachor lived nine and twenty years , and begot Thare .
And Nachor lived after he begot Thare , a hundred and <unk> years , and begot sons and daughters .
And Thare lived seventy years , and begot Abram , and Nachor , and <unk> .
And these are the generations of Thare : Thare begot Abram , Nachor , and <unk> .
And <unk> begot Lot .
And <unk> died before Thare his father , in the land of his nativity in <unk> of the Chaldees .
And Abram and Nachor married wives : the name of Abram ’ s wife was Sarai : and the name of Nachor ’ s wife , Melcha , the daughter of <unk> , father of Melcha and father of <unk> .
And Sarai was barren , and had no children .
And Thare took Abram his son , and Lot the son of <unk> , his son ’ s son , and Sarai his daughter in law , the wife of Abram his son , and brought them out of <unk> of the Chaldees , to go into the land of Chanaan : and they came as far as Haran , and dwelt there .
And the days of Thare were two hundred and five years , and he died in Haran .
Genesis Chapter 12 The call of Abram , and the promise made to him .
He <unk> in Chanaan , and then by occasion of a famine , goeth down to Egypt .
And the Lord said to Abram : Go forth out of thy country , and from thy kindred , and out of thy father ’ s house , and come into the land which I shall shew thee .
And I will make of thee a great nation , and I will bless thee , and magnify thy name , and thou shalt be blessed .
I will bless them that bless thee , and curse them that curse thee , and <unk> <unk> shall all the kindreds of the earth be blessed .
So Abram went out as the Lord had commanded him , and Lot went with him : Abram was <unk> years old when he went forth from Haran .
And he took Sarai his wife , and Lot his brother ’ s son , and all the substance which they had gathered , and the souls which they had gotten in Haran : and they went out to go into the land of Chanaan .
And when they were come into it ,
Abram passed through the country unto the place of Sichem , as far as the noble vale : now the Chanaanite was at that time in the land .
And the Lord appeared to Abram , and said to him : To thy seed will I give this land .
And he built there an altar to the Lord , who had appeared to him .
And passing on from thence to a mountain , that was on the east side of Bethel , he there pitched his tent , having Bethel on the west , and Hai on the east : he built there also an altar to the Lord , and called upon his name .
And Abram went forward , going and <unk> on to the south .
And there came a famine in the country : and Abram went down into Egypt , to sojourn there : for the famine was very grievous in the land .
And when he was near to enter into Egypt , he said to Sarai his wife : I know that thou art a beautiful woman :
And that when the Egyptians shall see thee , they will say : She is his wife : and they will kill me , and keep thee .
Say , therefore , I pray thee , that thou art my sister : that I may be well used for thee , and that my soul may live for thy sake .
My sister ....
This was no lie ; because she was his <unk> , being daughter to his brother <unk> , and therefore , in the <unk> of the Hebrews , she might truly be called his sister , as Lot is called Abram ’ s brother , Gen. <unk> .
See Gen. <unk> .
And when Abram was come into Egypt , the Egyptians saw the woman that she was very beautiful .
And the princes told Pharao , and praised her before him : and the woman was taken into the house of Pharao .
And they used Abram well for her sake .
And he had sheep and oxen and he asses , and men servants , and maid servants , and she asses , and camels .
But the Lord scourged Pharao and his house with most grievous stripes for Sarai , Abram ’ s wife .
And Pharao called Abram , and said to him : What is this that thou hast done to me ?
Why didst thou not tell me that she was thy wife ?
For what cause didst thou say , she was thy sister , that I might take her to my wife ?
Now therefore there is thy wife , take her , and go thy way .
And Pharao gave his men orders concerning Abram : and they led him away and his wife , and all that he had .
Genesis Chapter 13 Abram and Lot part from each other .
God ’ s promise to Abram .
And Abram went up out of Egypt , he and his wife , and all that he had , and Lot with him into the south .
And he was very rich in possession of gold and silver .
And he returned by the way , that he came , from the south to Bethel , to the place where before he had pitched his tent between Bethel and Hai ,
In the place of the altar which he had made before , and there he called upon the name of the Lord .
But Lot also , who was with Abram , had flocks of sheep , and herds of beasts , and tents .
Neither was the land able to bear them , that they might dwell together : for their substance was great , and they could not dwell together .
Whereupon also there arose a strife between the <unk> of Abram and of Lot .
And at that time the Chanaanite and the Pherezite <unk> in that country .
Abram therefore said to Lot : Let there be no <unk> , I beseech thee , between me and thee , and between my <unk> and thy <unk> : for we are brethren .
Behold the whole land is before thee : depart from me , I pray thee : if thou wilt go to the left hand , I will take the right : if thou choose the right hand , I will pass to the left .
And Lot lifting up his eyes , saw all the country about the Jordan , which was watered throughout , before the Lord destroyed Sodom and Gomorrha , as the paradise of the Lord , and like Egypt as one comes to Segor .
And Lot chose to himself the country about the Jordan , and he departed from the east : and they were separated one brother from the other .
Abram dwelt in the land of Chanaan : and Lot abode in the towns , that were about the Jordan , and dwelt in Sodom .
And the men of Sodom were very wicked , and sinners before the face of the Lord beyond measure .
And the Lord said to Abram , after Lot was separated from him : Lift up thy eyes , and look from the place wherein thou now art , to the north and to the south , to the east and to the west .
All the land which thou seest , I will give to thee , and to thy seed for ever .
And I will make thy seed as the dust of the earth : if any man be able to number the dust of the earth , he shall be able to number thy seed also .
Arise and walk through the land in the length , and the breadth thereof : for I will give it to thee .
So Abram <unk> his tent , came , and dwelt by the vale of Mambre , which is in Hebron : and he built there an altar to the Lord .
Genesis Chapter 14 The <unk> of the four kings ; the victory of Abram ; he is blessed by Melchisedech .
And it came to pass at that time , that <unk> , king of <unk> , and <unk> , king of <unk> , and <unk> , king of the <unk> , and <unk> , king of nations ,
<unk> war against <unk> , king of Sodom , and against <unk> , king of Gomorrha , and against <unk> , king of <unk> , and against <unk> , king of <unk> , and against the king of Bala , which is Segor .
All these came together into the <unk> vale , which now is the salt sea .
For they had served <unk> twelve years , and in the thirteenth year they revolted from him .
And in the fourteenth year came <unk> , and the kings that were with him : and they smote the Raphaim in <unk> , and the <unk> with them , and the <unk> in Save of <unk> .
And the <unk> in the mountains of Seir , even to the plains of Pharan , which is in the wilderness .
And they returned , and came to the fountain of <unk> , the same is Cades : and they smote all the country of the Amalecites , and the <unk> that dwelt in <unk> .
And the king of Sodom , and the king of Gomorrha , and the king of <unk> , and the king of <unk> , and the king of Bala , which is Segor , went out : and they set themselves against them in battle array , in the <unk> vale :
To wit , against <unk> king of the <unk> , and <unk> king of nations , and <unk> king of <unk> , and <unk> king of <unk> : four kings against five .
Now the <unk> vale had many <unk> of <unk> .
And the king of Sodom , and the king of Gomorrha turned their backs , and were overthrown there : and they that remained , fled to the mountain .
Of <unk> .
<unk> ....
This was a kind of pitch , which served for mortar in the building of <unk> , Gen. <unk> , and was used by Noe in <unk> the ark .
And they took all the substance of the <unk> , and <unk> , and all their victuals , and went their way :
And Lot also , the son of Abram ’ s brother , who dwelt in Sodom , and his substance .
And behold one , that had escaped , told Abram the Hebrew , who dwelt in the vale of Mambre the Amorrhite , the brother of <unk> , and the brother of <unk> : for these had made a league with Abram .
Which when Abram had heard , to wit , that his brother Lot was taken , he numbered of the servants born in his house , three hundred and eighteen , well appointed : and pursued them to Dan .
And <unk> his company , he rushed upon them in the night , and defeated them : and pursued them as far as <unk> , which is on the left hand of Damascus .
And he brought back all the substance , and Lot his brother , with his substance , the women also , and the people .
And the king of Sodom went out to meet him , after he returned from the slaughter of <unk> , and of the kings that were with him in the vale of Save , which is the king ’ s vale .
But Melchisedech , the king of <unk> , bringing forth bread and wine , for he was the priest of the most high God ,
Blessed him , and said : Blessed be Abram by the most high God , who created heaven and earth .
And blessed be the most high God , by whose protection , the enemies are in thy hands .
And he gave him the tithes of all .
And the king of Sodom said to Abram : Give me the persons , and the rest take to thyself .
And he answered him : I lift up my hand to the Lord God the most high , the <unk> of heaven and earth ,
That from the very <unk> <unk> unto the <unk> <unk> , I will not take of any things that are thine , lest thou say : I have enriched Abram .
Except such things as the young men have eaten , and the <unk> of the men that came with me , <unk> , <unk> , and Mambre : these shall take their <unk> .
Genesis Chapter 15 God promiseth seed to Abram .
His faith , sacrifice and vision .
Now when these things were done , the word of the Lord came to Abram by a vision , saying : Fear not , Abram , I am thy protector , and thy reward exceeding great .
And Abram said : Lord God , what wilt thou give me ?
I shall go without children : and the son of the steward of my house is this Damascus Eliezer .
And Abram added : But to me thou hast not given seed : and lo my servant born in my house , shall be my heir .
And immediately the word of the Lord came to him , saying : He shall not be thy heir : but he that shall come out of thy bowels , him shalt thou have for thy heir .
And he brought him forth abroad , and said to him : Look up to heaven and number the stars if thou canst .
And he said to him : So shall thy seed be .
Abram believed God , and it was reputed to him unto justice .
And he said to him : I am the Lord who brought thee out from <unk> of the Chaldees , to give thee this land , and that thou mightest possess it .
But he said : Lord God , whereby may I know that I shall possess it ?
And the Lord answered , and said : Take me a cow of three years old , and a <unk> of three years , and a ram of three years , a <unk> also , and a <unk> .
And he took all these , and divided them in the midst , and laid the two pieces of each one against the other : but the birds he divided not .
And the fowls came down upon the carcasses , and Abram drove them away .
And when the sun was setting , a deep sleep fell upon Abram , and a great and <unk> horror seized upon him .
And it was said unto him : Know thou <unk> that thy seed shall be a stranger in a land not their own , and they shall bring them under bondage , and afflict them four hundred years .
But I will judge the nation which they shall serve , and after this they shall come out with great substance .
And thou shalt go to thy fathers in peace , and be buried in a good old age .
But in the fourth generation they shall return hither : for as yet the iniquities of the Amorrhites are not at the full until this present time .
And when the sun was set , there arose a dark mist , and there appeared a <unk> furnace , and a lamp of fire passing between those divisions .
That day God made a covenant with Abram , saying : To thy seed will I give this land , from the river to Egypt even to the great river Euphrates .
The <unk> , and <unk> , the <unk> ,
And the Hethites , and the <unk> , the Raphaim also ,
And the Amorrhites , and the Chanaanites , and the <unk> , and the Jebusites .
Genesis Chapter 16 Abram marrieth Agar , who bringeth forth Ismael .
Now Sarai , the wife of Abram , had brought forth no children : but having a handmaid , an Egyptian , named Agar ,
She said to her husband : Behold , the Lord hath <unk> me from bearing : go in unto my handmaid , it may be I may have children of her at least .
And when he agreed to her request ,
She took Agar the Egyptian her handmaid , ten years after they first dwelt in the land of Chanaan , and gave her to her husband to wife .
To wife .... <unk> of wives , though contrary to the <unk> <unk> of marriage , Gen. <unk> , was by divine dispensation allowed to the <unk> : which <unk> seems to have continued during the time of the law of Moses .
But Christ our Lord reduced marriage to its <unk> <unk> .
Matt .
19 .
And he went in to her .
But she <unk> that she was with child , despised her mistress .
And Sarai said to Abram : Thou dost unjustly with me : I gave my handmaid into thy bosom , and she <unk> herself to be with child , despiseth me .
The Lord judge between me and thee .
And Abram made answer , and said to her : Behold thy handmaid is in thy own hand , use her as it pleaseth thee .
And when Sarai afflicted her , she ran away .
And the angel of the Lord having found her , by a fountain of water in the wilderness , which is in the way to Sur in the desert ,
He said to her : Agar , handmaid of Sarai , whence comest thou ?
and whither goest thou ?
And she answered : I flee from the face of Sarai , my mistress .
And the angel of the Lord said to her : Return to thy mistress , and humble thyself under her hand .
And again he said : I will multiply thy seed exceedingly , and it shall not be numbered for multitude .
And again : Behold , said he , thou art with child , and thou shalt bring forth a son : and thou shalt call his name Ismael , because the Lord hath heard thy affliction .
He shall be a wild man : his hand will be against all men , and all men ’ s hands against him : and he shall pitch his tents over against all his brethren .
And she called the name of the Lord that spoke unto her : Thou the God who hast seen me .
For she said : <unk> , here have I seen the hinder parts of him that seeth me .
Therefore she called that well , the well of him that liveth and seeth me .
The same is between Cades and <unk> .
And Agar brought forth a son to Abram : who called his name Ismael .
Abram was four <unk> and six years old when Agar brought him forth Ismael .
Genesis Chapter 17 The <unk> of circumcision .
And after he began to be ninety and nine years old , the Lord appeared to him : and said unto him : I am the Almighty God : walk before me , and be perfect .
And I will make my covenant between me and thee : and I will multiply thee exceedingly .
Abram fell flat on his face .
And God said to him : I am , and my covenant is with thee , and thou shalt be a father of many nations .
Neither shall thy name be called any more Abram : but thou shalt be called Abraham : because I have made thee a father of many nations .
Abram .... in the Hebrew , signifies a high father : but Abraham , the father of the multitude ; Sarai signifies my <unk> , but Sara <unk> <unk> .
And I will make thee increase exceedingly , and I will make nations of thee , and kings shall come out of thee .
And I will establish my covenant between me and thee , and between thy seed after thee in their generations , by a perpetual covenant : to be a God to thee , and to thy seed after thee .
And I will give to thee , and to thy seed , the land of thy <unk> , all the land of Chanaan , for a perpetual possession , and I will be their God .
Again God said to Abraham : And thou therefore shalt keep my covenant , and thy seed after thee in their generations .
This is my covenant which you shall observe between me and you , and thy seed after thee : All the <unk> of you shall be circumcised .
And you shall <unk> the flesh of your <unk> , that it may be for a sign of the covenant between me and you .
An infant of eight days old shall be circumcised among you , every <unk> in your generations : he that is born in the house , as well as the bought servant , shall be circumcised , and whosoever is not of your stock :
And my covenant shall be in your flesh for a perpetual covenant .
The male whose flesh of his <unk> shall not be circumcised , that soul shall be destroyed out of his people : because he hath broken my covenant .
God said also to Abraham : Sarai thy wife thou shalt not call Sarai , but Sara .
And I will bless her , and of her I will give thee a son , whom I will bless , and he shall become nations , and kings of people shall spring from him .
Abraham fell upon his face , and laughed , saying in his heart : Shall a son , thinkest thou , be born to him that is a hundred years old ?
and shall Sara that is ninety years old bring forth ?
And he said to God : O that Ismael may live before thee .
And God said to Abraham : Sara thy wife shall bear thee a son , and thou shalt call his name Isaac , and I will establish my covenant with him for a perpetual covenant , and with his seed after him .
And as for Ismael I have also heard thee .
Behold , I will bless him , and increase , and multiply him exceedingly : he shall beget twelve chiefs , and I will make him a great nation .
But my covenant I will establish with Isaac , whom Sara shall bring forth to thee at this time in the next year .
And when he had left off speaking with him , God went up from Abraham .
And Abraham took Ismael his son , and all that were born in his house : and all whom he had bought , every male among the men of his house : and he circumcised the flesh of their <unk> forthwith the very same day , as God had commanded him .
Abraham was ninety and nine years old , when he circumcised the flesh of his <unk> .
And Ismael his son was full thirteen years old at the time of his circumcision .
The <unk> day was Abraham circumcised and Ismael his son .
And all the men of his house , as well they that were born in his house , as the bought servants and strangers , were circumcised with him .
Genesis Chapter 18 Angels are <unk> by Abraham .
They <unk> the birth of Isaac .
Abraham ’ s prayer for the men of Sodom .
And the Lord appeared to him in the vale of Mambre as he was sitting at the door of his tent , in the very heat of the day .
And when he had lifted up his eyes , there appeared to him three men standing near to him : and as soon as he saw them , he ran to meet them from the door of his tent , and adored down to the ground .
And he said : Lord , if I have found favour in thy sight , pass not away from thy servant .
But I will fetch a little water , and wash ye your feet , and rest ye under the tree .
And I will set a morsel of bread , and strengthen ye your heart , afterwards you shall pass on : for therefore are you come aside to your servant .
And they said : Do as thou hast spoken .
Abraham made haste into the tent to Sara , and said to her : Make haste , <unk> together three measures of flour , and make <unk> upon the hearth .
And he himself ran to the herd , and took from thence a calf , very tender and very good , and gave it to a young man , who made haste and boiled it .
He took also <unk> and milk , and the calf which he had boiled , and set before them : but he stood by them under the tree .
And when they had eaten , they said to him : Where is Sara thy wife ?
He answered : Lo she is in the tent .
And he said to him : I will return and come to thee at this time , life <unk> , and Sara , thy wife , shall have a son .
Which when Sara heard , she laughed behind the door of the tent .
Now they were both old , and far advanced in years , and it had ceased to be with Sara after the manner of women .
And she laughed secretly , saying : After I am grown old , and my lord is an old man , shall I give myself to pleasure ?
And the Lord said to Abraham : Why did Sara laugh , saying : Shall I , who am an old woman , bear a child indeed ?
Is there any thing hard to God ?
According to appointment I will return to thee at this same time , life <unk> , and Sara shall have a son .
Sara denied , saying : I did not laugh : for she was afraid .
But the Lord said : <unk> ; but thou didst laugh .
And when the men rose up from thence , they turned their eyes towards Sodom : and Abraham walked with them , bringing them on the way .
And the Lord said : Can I hide from Abraham what I am about to do :
Seeing he shall become a great and mighty nation , and in him all the nations of the earth shall be blessed ?
For I know that he will command his children , and his household after him , to keep the way of the Lord , and do judgment and justice : that for Abraham ’ s sake , the Lord may bring to effect all the things he hath spoken unto him .
And the Lord said : The cry of Sodom and Gomorrha is multiplied , and their sin is become exceedingly grievous .
I will go down and see whether they have done according to the cry that is come to me ; or whether it be not so , that I may know .
I will go down , etc ....
The Lord here <unk> his discourse to the way of speaking and <unk> amongst men ; for he knoweth all things , and <unk> not to go <unk> for <unk> .
<unk> here , that two of the three angels went away immediately for Sodom ; whilst the third , who <unk> the Lord , remained with Abraham .
And they turned themselves from thence , and went their way to Sodom : but Abraham as yet stood before the Lord .
And drawing nigh , he said : Wilt thou destroy the just with the wicked ?
If there be fifty just men in the city , shall they perish withal ?
and wilt thou not spare that place for the sake of the fifty just , if they be therein ?
<unk> be it from thee to do this thing , and to slay the just with the wicked , and for the just to be in like case as the wicked ; this is not <unk> thee : thou who judgest all the earth , wilt not make this judgment .
And the Lord said to him : If I find in Sodom fifty just within the city , I will spare the whole place for their sake .
And Abraham answered , and said : Seeing I have once begun , I will speak to my Lord , whereas I am dust and ashes .
What if there be five less than fifty just persons ?
wilt thou for five and forty destroy the whole city : And he said : I will not destroy it , if I find five and forty .
And again he said to him : But if forty be found there , what wilt thou do ?
He said : I will not destroy it for the sake of forty .
Lord , saith he , be not angry , I beseech thee , if I speak : What if thirty shall be found there ?
He answered : I will not do it , if I find thirty there .
Seeing , saith he , I have once begun , I will speak to my Lord : What if twenty be found there ?
He said : I will not destroy it for the sake of twenty .
I beseech thee , saith he , be not angry , Lord , if I speak yet once more : What if ten shall be found there ?
And he said : I will not destroy it for the sake of ten .
And the Lord departed , after he had left speaking to Abraham : and Abraham returned to his place .
Genesis Chapter 19 Lot , <unk> Angels in his house , is delivered from Sodom , which is destroyed : his wife for looking back is turned into a statue of salt .
And the two angels came to Sodom in the evening , and Lot was sitting in the gate of the city .
And seeing them , he rose up and went to meet them : and worshipped prostrate to the ground .
And said : I beseech you , my lords , turn in to the house of your servant , and lodge there : wash your feet , and in the morning you shall go on your way .
And they said : No , but we will abide in the street .
He pressed them very much to turn in unto him : and when they were come into his house , he made them a feast , and baked unleavened bread , and they ate :
But before they went to bed , the men of the city <unk> the house , both young and old , all the people together .
And they called Lot , and said to him : Where are the men that came in to thee at night ?
bring them out hither , that we may know them :
Lot went out to them , and shut the door after him , and said :
Do not so , I beseech you , my brethren , do not commit this evil .
I have two daughters who , as yet , have not known man ; I will bring them out to you , and abuse you them as it shall please you , so that you do no evil to these men , because they are come in under the shadow of my roof .
But they said : Get thee back thither .
And again : Thou camest in , said they , as a stranger , was it to be a judge ?
therefore we will afflict thee more than them .
And they pressed very violently upon Lot : and they were even at the point of breaking open the doors .
And behold the men put out their hand , and drew in Lot unto them , and shut the door .
And them , that were without , they struck with blindness from the least to the greatest , so that they could not find the door .
And they said to Lot : Hast thou here any of thine ?
son in law , or sons , or daughters , all that are thine bring them out of this city :
For we will destroy this place , because their cry is grown loud before the Lord , who hath sent us to destroy them .
So Lot went out , and spoke to his sons in law that were to have his daughters , and said : Arise : get you out of this place , because the Lord will destroy this city .
And he seemed to them to speak as it were in <unk> .
And when it was morning , the angels pressed him , saying : Arise , take thy wife , and the two daughters that thou hast : lest thou also perish in the wickedness of the city .
And as he <unk> , they took his hand , and the hand of his wife , and of his two daughters , because the Lord spared him .
And they brought him forth , and set him without the city : and there they spoke to him , saying : Save thy life : look not back , neither stay thou in all the country about : but save thy self in the mountain , lest thou be also consumed .
And Lot said to them : I beseech thee , my Lord ,
Because thy servant hath found grace before thee , and thou hast magnified thy mercy , which thou hast shewn to me , in saving my life , and I cannot escape to the mountain , lest some evil <unk> me , and I die .
There is this city here at hand , to which I may flee , it is a little one , and I shall be saved in it : is it not a little one , and my soul shall live ?
And he said to him : Behold also in this , I have heard thy prayers , not to destroy the city for which thou hast spoken .
Make haste , and be saved there : because I cannot do any thing till thou go in thither .
Therefore the name of that city was called Segor .
Segor .... That is , a little one .
The sun was risen upon the earth , and Lot entered into Segor .
And the Lord rained upon Sodom and Gomorrha brimstone and fire from the Lord out of heaven .
And he destroyed these cities , and all the country about , all the inhabitants of the cities , and all things that spring from the earth .
And his wife looking behind her , was turned into a statue of salt .
And his wife .... As a standing memorial to the servants of God to proceed in virtue , and not to look back to <unk> or its <unk> .
And Abraham got up early in the morning , and in the place where he had stood before with the Lord :
He looked towards Sodom and Gomorrha , and the whole land of that country : and he saw the ashes rise up from the earth as the smoke of a furnace .
Now when God destroyed the cities of that country , remembering Abraham , he delivered Lot out of the destruction of the cities wherein he had dwelt .
And Lot went up out of Segor , and abode in the mountain , and his two daughters with him ( for he was afraid to stay in Segor ) and he dwelt in a cave , he and his two daughters with him .
And the elder said to the younger : Our father is old , and there is no man left on the earth , to come in unto us after the manner of the whole earth .
Come , let us make him drunk with wine , and let us lie with him , that we may preserve seed of our father .
And they made their father drink wine that night : and the elder went in , and lay with her father : but he perceived not , neither when his daughter lay down , nor when she rose up .
And the next day the elder said to the younger : Behold I lay last night with my father , let us make him drink wine also to night , and thou shalt lie with him , that we may save seed of our father .
They made their father drink wine that night also , and the younger daughter went in , and lay with him : and neither then did he perceive when she lay down , nor when she rose up .
So the two daughters of Lot were with child by their father .
And the elder bore a son , and she called his name Moab : he is the father of the Moabites unto this day .
The younger also bore a son , and she called his name Ammon ; that is , the son of my people : he is the father of the Ammonites unto this day .
Genesis Chapter 20 Abraham sojourned in Gerara : Sara is taken into king Abimelech ’ s house , but by God ’ s commandment is restored <unk> .
Abraham removed from thence to the south country , and dwelt between Cades and Sur , and sojourned in Gerara .
And he said of Sara his wife : She is my sister .
So Abimelech the king of Gerara sent , and took her .
And God came to Abimelech in a dream by night , and he said to him : Lo thou shalt die for the woman that thou hast taken : for she hath a husband .
Now Abimelech had not touched her , and he said : Lord , wilt thou slay a nation that is ignorant and just ?
Did not he say to me : She is my sister : and she say , He is my brother ?
in the simplicity of my heart , and cleanness of my hands have I done this .
And God said to him : And I know that thou didst it with a sincere heart : and therefore I <unk> thee from <unk> against me , and I suffered thee not to touch her .
Now therefore restore the man his wife , for he is a prophet : and he shall pray for thee , and thou shalt live : but if thou wilt not restore her , know that thou shalt surely die , thou and all that are thine .
And Abimelech forthwith rising up in the night , called all his servants : and spoke all these words in their hearing , and all the men were exceedingly afraid .
And Abimelech called also for Abraham , and said to him : What hast thou done to us ?
what have we offended thee in , that thou hast brought upon me and upon my kingdom a great sin ?
thou hast done to us what thou <unk> not to do .
And again he <unk> with him , and said : What sawest thou , that thou hast done this ?
Abraham answered : I thought with myself , saying : Perhaps there is not the fear of God in this place : and they will kill me for the sake of my wife :
<unk> , otherwise also she is truly my sister , the daughter of my father , and not the daughter of my mother , and I took her to wife .
And after God brought me out of my father ’ s house , I said to her : Thou shalt do me this kindness : In every place , to which we shall come , thou shalt say that I am thy brother .
And Abimelech took sheep and oxen , and servants and handmaids , and gave to Abraham : and restored to him Sara his wife ,
And said : The land is before you , dwell wheresoever it shall please thee .
And to Sara he said : Behold I have given thy brother a thousand pieces of silver , this shall serve thee for a covering of thy eyes to all that are with thee , and whithersoever thou shalt go : and remember thou wast taken .
And when Abraham prayed , God healed Abimelech and his wife , and his handmaids , and they bore children :
For the Lord had closed up every womb of the house of Abimelech , on account of Sara , Abraham ’ s wife .
Genesis Chapter 21 Isaac is born .
Agar and Ismael are cast forth .
And the Lord visited Sara , as he had promised : and fulfilled what he had spoken .
And she conceived and bore a son in her old age , at the time that God had foretold her .
And Abraham called the name of his son , whom Sara bore him , Isaac .
Isaac ....
This word signifies laughter .
And he circumcised him the eighth day , as God had commanded him ,
When he was a hundred years old : for at this age of his father , was Isaac born .
And Sara said : God hath made a laughter for me : whosoever shall hear of it will laugh with me .
And again she said : Who would believe that Abraham should hear that Sara gave suck to a son , whom she bore to him in his old age ?
And the child grew , and was <unk> : and Abraham made a great feast on the day of his <unk> .
And when Sara had seen the son of Agar , the Egyptian , playing with Isaac , her son , she said to Abraham :
Cast out this bondwoman and her son ; for the son of the bondwoman shall not be heir with my son Isaac .
Abraham took this grievously for his son .
And God said to him : Let it not seem grievous to thee for the boy , and for thy bondwoman : in all that Sara hath said to thee , hearken to her voice : for in Isaac shall thy seed be called .
But I will make the son also of the bondwoman a great nation , because he is thy seed .
So Abraham rose up in the morning , and taking bread and a bottle of water , put it upon her shoulder , and delivered the boy , and sent her away .
And she departed , and wandered in the wilderness of Bersabee .
And when the water in the bottle was spent , she cast the boy under one of the trees that were there .
And she went her way , and sat over against him a great way off , as far as a bow can carry , for she said : I will not see the boy die : and sitting over against , she lifted up her voice and wept .
And God heard the voice of the boy : and an angel of God called to Agar from heaven , saying : What art thou doing , Agar ?
fear not ; for God hath heard the voice of the boy , from the place wherein he is .
Arise , take up the boy , and hold him by the hand , for I will make him a great nation .
And God opened her eyes : and she saw a well of water , and went and filled the bottle , and gave the boy to drink .
And God was with him : and he grew , and dwelt in the wilderness , and became a young man , an <unk> .
And he dwelt in the wilderness of Pharan , and his mother took a wife for him out of the land of Egypt .
At the same time Abimelech , and <unk> the general of his army , said to Abraham : God is with thee in all that thou dost .
<unk> therefore by God , that thou wilt not hurt me , nor my posterity , nor my stock : but according to the kindness that I have done to thee , thou shalt do to me , and to the land wherein thou hast lived a stranger .
And Abraham said : I will swear .
And he reproved Abimelech for a well of water , which his servants had taken away by force .
And Abimelech answered : I knew not who did this thing : and thou didst not tell me , and I heard not of it till today .
Then Abraham took sheep and oxen , and gave them to Abimelech : and both of them made a league .
And Abraham set apart seven <unk> of the flock .
And Abimelech said to him : What mean these seven <unk> which thou hast set apart ?
But he said : Thou shalt take seven <unk> at my hand : that they may be a testimony for me , that I dug this well .
Therefore that place was called Bersabee ; because there both of them did swear .
Bersabee .... That is , the well of oath .
And they made a league for the well of oath .
And Abimelech and <unk> , the general of his army , arose and returned to the land of the <unk> .
But Abraham planted a grove in Bersabee , and there called upon the name of the Lord God eternal .
And he was a sojourner in the land of the <unk> many days .
Genesis Chapter 22 The faith and obedience of Abraham is proved in his <unk> to sacrifice his son Isaac .
He is stayed from the act by an angel .
<unk> promises are renewed to him .
His brother Nachor ’ s issue .
After these things , God tempted Abraham , and said to him : Abraham , Abraham .
And he answered : Here I am .
God tempted , etc .... God <unk> no man to evil , James <unk> ; but by trial and <unk> maketh known to the world , and to ourselves , what we are , as here by this trial the <unk> faith and obedience of Abraham was made manifest .
He said to him : Take thy only begotten son Isaac , whom thou lovest , and go into the land of vision ; and there thou shalt offer him for an holocaust upon one of the mountains which I will shew thee .
So Abraham rising up in the night , <unk> his ass , and took with him two young men , and Isaac his son : and when he had cut wood for the holocaust , he went his way to the place which God had commanded him .
And on the third day , lifting up his eyes , he saw the place afar off .
And he said to his young men : Stay you here with the ass ; I and the boy will go with speed as far as <unk> , and after we have worshipped , will return to you .
And he took the wood for the holocaust , and laid it upon Isaac his son ; and he himself carried in his hands fire and a sword .
And as they two went on together ,
Isaac said to his father : My father .
And he answered : What wilt thou , son ?
Behold , saith he , fire and wood : where is the victim for the holocaust ?
And Abraham said : God will provide himself a victim for an holocaust , my son .
So they went on together .
And they came to the place which God had shewn him , where he built an altar , and laid the wood in order upon it ; and when he had bound Isaac his son , he laid him on the altar upon the <unk> of wood .
And he put forth his hand , and took the sword , to sacrifice his son .
And behold , an angel of the Lord from heaven called to him , saying : Abraham , Abraham .
And he answered : Here I am .
And he said to him : Lay not thy hand upon the boy , neither do thou any thing to him : now I know that thou <unk> God , and hast not spared thy only begotten son for my sake .
Abraham lifted up his eyes , and saw behind his back a ram , amongst the briers , <unk> fast by the horns , which he took and offered for a holocaust instead of his son .
And he called the name of that place , The Lord seeth .
Whereupon , even to this day , it is said : In the mountain the Lord will see .
And the angel of the Lord called to Abraham a second time from heaven , saying :
By my own self have I sworn , saith the Lord : because thou hast done this thing , and hast not spared thy only begotten son for my sake :
I will bless thee , and I will multiply thy seed as the stars of heaven , and as the sand that is by the sea shore ; thy seed shall possess the gates of their enemies .
And in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed , because thou hast obeyed my voice .
Abraham returned to his young men , and they went to Bersabee together , and he dwelt there .
After these things , it was told Abraham , that Melcha also had borne children to Nachor his brother .
<unk> , the firstborn , and <unk> , his brother , and <unk> the father of the Syrians ,
And <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> ,
And <unk> , of whom was born Rebecca : these eight did Melcha bear to Nachor , Abraham ’ s brother .
And his concubine , named <unk> , bore <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> , and Maacha .
Genesis Chapter 23 Sara ’ s death and burial in the field bought of Ephron .
And Sara lived a hundred and <unk> years .
And she died in the city of <unk> which is Hebron , in the land of Chanaan : and Abraham came to mourn and weep for her .
And after he rose up from the <unk> <unk> , he spoke to the children of Heth , saying :
I am a stranger and sojourner among you : give me the right of a burying place with you , that I may bury my dead .
The children of Heth answered , saying :
My lord , hear us , thou art a prince of God among us : bury thy dead in our principal sepulchres : and no man shall have power to hinder thee from burying thy dead in his sepulchre .
Abraham rose up , and bowed down to the people of the land , to wit , the children of Heth : <unk> down to the people .... <unk> , literally adored .
But this word here , as well as in many other places in the Latin scriptures , is used to signify only an inferior honour and reverence paid to men , expressed by a bowing down of the body .
And said to them : If it please your soul that I should bury my dead , hear me , and <unk> for me to Ephron the son of <unk> .
That he may give me the double cave , which he hath in the end of his field : For as much money as it is worth he shall give it me before you , for a possession of a burying place .
Now Ephron dwelt in the midst of the children of Heth .
And Ephron made answer to Abraham in the hearing of all that went in at the gate of the city , saying :
Let it not be so , my lord , but do thou rather hearken to what I say : The field I deliver to thee , and the cave that is therein ; in the presence of the children of my people , bury thy dead .
Abraham bowed down before the people of the land .
And he spoke to Ephron , in the presence of the people : I beseech thee to hear me : I will give money for the field ; take it , and so will I bury my dead in it .
And Ephron answered :
My lord , hear me .
The ground which thou <unk> , is worth four hundred sicles of silver : this is the price between me and thee : but what is this ?
bury thy dead .
And when Abraham had heard this , he weighed out the money that Ephron had asked , in the hearing of the children of Heth , four hundred sicles of silver , of common <unk> money .
And the field that before was Ephron ’ s , wherein was the double cave , looking towards Mambre , both it and the cave , and all the trees thereof , in all its limits round about ,
Was made sure to Abraham for a possession , in the sight of the children of Heth , and of all that went in at the gate of his city .
And so Abraham buried Sara , his wife , in the double cave of the field , that looked towards Mambre , this is Hebron in the land of Chanaan .
And the field was made sure to Abraham , and the cave that was in it , for a possession to bury in , by the children of Heth .
Genesis Chapter 24 Abraham ’ s servant , sent by him into Mesopotamia , bringeth from thence Rebecca , who is married to Isaac .
Now Abraham was old , and advanced in age ; and the Lord had blessed him in all things .
And he said to the elder servant of his house , who was ruler over all he had : Put thy hand under my thigh ,
That I may make thee swear by the Lord , the God of heaven and earth , that thou take not a wife for my son , of the daughters of the Chanaanites , among whom I dwell :
But that thou go to my own country and kindred , and take a wife from thence for my son Isaac .
The servant answered : If the woman will not come with me into this land , must I bring thy son back again to the place from whence thou camest out ?
And Abraham said : Beware thou never bring my son back again thither .
The Lord God of heaven , who took me out of my father ’ s house , and out of my native country , who spoke to me , and swore to me , saying : To thy seed will I give this land : he will send his angel before thee , and thou shalt take from thence a wife for my son .
He will send his angel before thee ....
This <unk> that the Hebrews believed that God gave them <unk> angels for their protection .
But if the woman will not follow thee , thou shalt not be bound by the oath : only bring not my son back thither again .
The servant , therefore , put his hand under the thigh of Abraham , his lord , and swore to him upon his word .
And he took ten camels of his master ’ s herd , and departed , carrying something of all his goods with him , and he set forward and went on to Mesopotamia , to the city of Nachor .
And when he had made the camels lie down without the town , near a well of water , in the evening , at the time when women are wont to come out to draw water , he said :
O Lord , the God of my master , Abraham , meet me today , I beseech thee , and shew kindness to my master , Abraham .
Behold , I stand nigh the spring of water , and the daughters of the inhabitants of this city will come out to draw water :
Now , therefore , the maid to whom I shall say : Let down thy pitcher that I may drink : and she shall answer , <unk> , and I will give thy camels drink also : let it be the same whom thou hast provided for thy servant Isaac : and by this , I shall understand that thou hast shewn kindness to my master .
He had not yet ended these words within himself , and behold Rebecca came out , the daughter of <unk> , son of Melcha , wife to Nachor the brother of Abraham , having a pitcher on her shoulder :
An exceeding comely maid , and a most beautiful virgin , and not known to man : and she went down to the spring , and filled her pitcher , and was coming back .
And the servant ran to meet her , and said : Give me a little water to drink of thy pitcher .
And she answered : <unk> , my lord .
And quickly she let down the pitcher upon her arm , and gave him drink .
And when he had drunk , she said : I will draw water for thy camels also , till they all drink .
And pouring out the pitcher into the <unk> , she ran back to the well to draw water ; and having drawn , she gave to all the camels .
But he <unk> , beheld her with silence , desirous to know whether the Lord had made his journey prosperous or not .
And after that the camels had drunk , the man took out golden earrings , weighing two sicles ; and as many <unk> , of ten sicles weight .
And he said to her : Whose daughter art thou ?
tell me : is there any place in thy father ’ s house to lodge ?
And she answered : I am the daughter of <unk> , the son of Melcha , whom she bore to Nachor .
And she said , moreover , to him : We have good store of both straw and hay , and a large place to lodge in .
The man bowed himself down , and adored the Lord ,
Saying : Blessed be the Lord God of my master Abraham , who hath not taken away his mercy and truth from my master , and hath brought me the straight way into the house of my master ’ s brother .
Then the maid ran , and told in her mother ’ s house all that she had heard .
And Rebecca had a brother , named Laban , who went out in haste to the man , to the well .
And when he had seen the earrings and <unk> in his sister ’ s hands , and had heard all that she related , saying , Thus and thus the man spoke to me : he came to the man who stood by the camels , and near to the spring of water ,
And said to him : Come in , thou blessed of the Lord ; why <unk> thou without ?
I have prepared the house , and a place for the camels .
And he brought him into his lodging ; and he <unk> the camels , and gave straw and hay , and water to wash his feet , and the feet of the men that were come with him .
And bread was set before him .
But he said : I will not eat , till I tell my <unk> .
He answered him : Speak .
And he said : I am the servant of Abraham :
And the Lord hath blessed my master <unk> , and he is become great : and he hath given him sheep and oxen , silver and gold , men servants and women servants , camels and asses .
And Sara , my master ’ s wife , hath borne my master a son in her old age , and he hath given him all that he had .
And my master made me swear , saying : Thou shalt not take a wife for my son of the Chanaanites , in whose land I dwell :
But thou shalt go to my father ’ s house , and shalt take a wife of my own kindred for my son :
But I answered my master : What if the woman will not come with me ?
The Lord , said he , in whose sight I walk , will send his angel with thee , and will direct thy way : and thou shalt take a wife for my son of my own kindred , and of my father ’ s house .
But thou shalt be clear from my curse , when thou shalt come to my kindred , if they will not give thee one .
And I came today to the well of water , and said : O Lord God of my master , Abraham , if thou hast prospered my way , wherein I now walk ,
Behold , I stand by the well of water , and the virgin , that shall come out to draw water , who shall hear me say : Give me a little water to drink of thy pitcher :
And shall say to me : Both drink thou , and I will also draw for thy camels : let the same be the woman , whom the Lord hath prepared for my master ’ s son .
And whilst I <unk> these things secretly with myself , Rebecca appeared , coming with a pitcher , which she carried on her shoulder : and she went down to the well and drew water .
And I said to her : Give me a little to drink .
And she speedily let down the pitcher from her shoulder , and said to me : Both drink thou , and to thy camels I will give drink .
I drank , and she watered the camels .
And I asked her , and said : Whose daughter art thou ?
And she answered : I am the daughter of <unk> , the son of Nachor , whom Melcha bore to him .
So I put earrings on her to adorn her face , and I put <unk> on her hands .
And falling down , I adored the Lord , blessing the Lord God of my master , Abraham , who hath brought me the straight way to take the daughter of my master ’ s brother for his son .
Wherefore , if you do according to mercy and truth with my master , tell me : but if it please you otherwise , tell me that also , that I may go to the right hand , or to the left .
And Laban and <unk> answered : The word hath proceeded from the Lord : we cannot speak any other thing to thee but his pleasure .
Behold , Rebecca is before thee , take her and go thy way , and let her be the wife of thy master ’ s son , as the Lord hath spoken .
Which when Abraham ’ s servant heard , falling down to the ground , he adored the Lord .
And bringing forth vessels of silver and gold , and garments , he gave them to Rebecca , for a present .
He offered gifts also to her <unk> , and to her mother .
And a banquet was made , and they ate and drank together , and lodged there .
And in the morning , the servant arose , and said : Let me depart , that I may go to my master .
And her brother and mother answered : Let the maid stay , at least , ten days with us , and afterwards she shall depart .
Stay me not , said he , because the Lord hath prospered my way : send me away , that I may go to my master .
And they said : Let us call the maid , and ask her will .
Let us call the maid , and ask her will .... Not as to her marriage , as she had already consented , but of her <unk> her parents and going to her husband .
And they called her , and when she was come , they asked : Wilt thou go with this man ?
She said : I will go .
So they sent her away , and her nurse , and Abraham ’ s servant , and his company .
<unk> prosperity to their sister , and saying : Thou art our sister , mayst thou increase to thousands of thousands ; and may thy seed possess the gates of their enemies .
So Rebecca and her maids , being set upon camels , followed the man : who with speed returned to his master .
At the same time , Isaac was walking along the way to the well which is called Of the living and the seeing : for he dwelt in the south country :
And he was gone forth to meditate in the field , the day being now well spent : and when he had lifted up his eyes , he saw camels coming afar off .
Rebecca also , when she saw Isaac , <unk> off the camel ,
And said to the servant : Who is that man who cometh towards us along the field ?
And he said to her : That man is my master .
But she quickly took her cloak , and covered herself .
And the servant told Isaac all that he had done .
24 : 67 . Who brought her into the tent of Sara his mother , and took her to wife : and he loved her so much , that it <unk> the sorrow which was <unk> by his mother ’ s death .
Genesis Chapter 25 Abraham ’ s children by <unk> ; his death and that of Ismael .
Isaac hath Esau and Jacob <unk> .
Esau <unk> his first birthright to Jacob .
And Abraham married another wife named <unk> : 25 : 2 . Who bore him <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> , and Madian , and <unk> , and <unk> .
<unk> also begot Saba , and <unk> .
The children of <unk> were <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> .
But of Madian was born <unk> , and <unk> , and Henoch , and <unk> , and <unk> : all these were the children of <unk> .
And Abraham gave all his possessions to Isaac :
And to the children of the concubines he gave gifts , and separated them from Isaac his son , while he yet lived , to the east country .
<unk> .... Agar and <unk> are here called concubines , ( though they were lawful wives , and in other places are so called , ) because they were of an inferior <unk> , and such in scripture are usually called concubines .
And the days of Abraham ’ s life were a hundred and <unk> years .
And <unk> he died in a good old age , and having lived a long time , and being full of days : and was gathered to his people .
And Isaac and Ismael his sons buried him in the double cave , which was <unk> in the field of Ephron the son of <unk> the Hethite , over against Mambre ,
Which he had bought of the children of Heth : there was he buried , and Sara his wife .
And after his death , God blessed Isaac his son , who dwelt by the well named Of the living and seeing .
These are the generations of Ismael the son of Abraham , whom Agar the Egyptian , Sara ’ s servant , bore unto him :
And these are the names of his children according to their calling and generations .
The firstborn of Ismael was <unk> , then Cedar , and <unk> , and <unk> ,
And <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> ,
<unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> .
These are the sons of Ismael : and these are their names by their <unk> and towns , twelve princes of their tribes .
And the years of Ismael ’ s life were a hundred and <unk> , and <unk> he died , and was gathered unto his people .
And he dwelt from <unk> as far as Sur , which looketh towards Egypt , to them that go towards the Assyrians .
He died in the presence of all his brethren .
These also are the generations of Isaac the son of Abraham : Abraham begot Isaac : 25 : 20 . Who when he was forty years old , took to wife Rebecca the daughter of <unk> the Syrian of Mesopotamia , sister to Laban .
And Isaac besought the Lord for his wife , because she was barren : and he heard him , and made Rebecca to conceive .
But the children <unk> in her womb , and she said : If it were to be so with me , what need was there to conceive ?
And she went to consult the Lord .
And he answering , said : Two nations are in thy womb , and two peoples shall be divided out of thy womb , and one people shall overcome the other , and the elder shall serve the younger .
And when her time was come to be delivered , behold <unk> were found in her womb .
He that came forth first was red , and <unk> like a skin : and his name was called Esau .
<unk> the other coming forth , held his brother ’ s foot in his hand : and therefore he was called Jacob .
Isaac was threescore years old when the children were born unto him .
And when they were grown up , Esau became a skilful <unk> , and a husbandman : but Jacob , a plain man , dwelt in tents .
Isaac loved Esau , because he ate of his <unk> : and Rebecca loved Jacob .
And Jacob boiled <unk> : to whom Esau , coming faint out of the field ,
Said : Give me of this red <unk> , for I am exceeding faint .
For which reason his name was called Edom .
And Jacob said to him : <unk> me thy first birthright .
He answered : Lo I die , what will the first birthright <unk> me ?
Jacob said : <unk> therefore to me .
Esau swore to him , and sold his first birthright .
And so taking bread and the <unk> of <unk> , he ate , and drank , and went on his way ; making little account of having sold his first birthright .
Genesis Chapter 26 Isaac <unk> in Gerara , where God <unk> to him the promise made to Abraham .
King Abimelech maketh league with him .
And when a famine came in the land , after that <unk> which had happened in the days of Abraham , Isaac went to Abimelech , king of the <unk> , to Gerara .
And the Lord appeared to him , and said : Go not down into Egypt , but stay in the land that I shall tell thee .
And sojourn in it , and I will be with thee , and will bless thee : for to thee and to thy seed I will give all these countries , to fulfil the oath which I swore to Abraham thy father .
And I will multiply thy seed like the stars of heaven : and I will give to thy posterity all these countries : and in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed .
Because Abraham obeyed my voice , and kept my precepts and commandments , and observed my ceremonies and laws .
So Isaac abode in Gerara .
And when he was asked by the men of that place , concerning his wife , he answered : She is my sister : for he was afraid to confess that she was his wife , thinking lest perhaps they would kill him because of her beauty .
And when very many days were passed , and he abode there , Abimelech , king of the <unk> , looking out through a window , saw him playing with Rebecca , his wife .
And calling for him , he said : It is evident she is thy wife : why didst thou <unk> her to be thy sister ?
He answered : I feared lest I should die for her sake .
And Abimelech said : Why hast thou deceived us ?
Some man of the people might have <unk> with thy wife , and thou hadst brought upon us a great sin .
And he commanded all the people , saying :
He that shall touch this man ’ s wife , shall surely be put to death .
And Isaac sowed in that land , and he found that same year a <unk> : and the Lord blessed him .
And the man was enriched , and he went on <unk> and <unk> , till he became exceeding great .
And he had possessions of sheep and of herds , and a very great family .
Wherefore the <unk> <unk> him ,
<unk> up at that time all the <unk> , that the servants of his father , Abraham , had digged , <unk> them up with earth :
<unk> that Abimelech himself said to Isaac : Depart from us , for thou art become much mightier than we .
So he departed , and came to the torrent of Gerara , to dwell there :
And he digged again other <unk> , which the servants of his father , Abraham , had digged , and which , after his death , the Philistines had of old stopped up : and he called them by the same names , by which his father before had called them .
And they digged in the torrent , and found living water : <unk> .... That is , a channel where sometimes a torrent or violent stream had run .
But there also the <unk> of Gerara <unk> against the <unk> of Isaac , saying : It is our water .
Wherefore he called the name of the well , on occasion of that which had happened , <unk> .
And they digged also another ; and for that they <unk> likewise , and he called the name of it , <unk> .
<unk> forward from thence , he digged another well , for which they <unk> not ; therefore he called the name thereof , <unk> , saying : Now hath the Lord given us room , and made us to increase upon the earth .
<unk> .... That is , <unk> , or room .
And he went up from that place to Bersabee ,
Where the Lord appeared to him that same night , saying : I am the God of Abraham thy father , do not fear , for I am with thee : I will bless thee , and multiply thy seed for my servant Abraham ’ s sake .
And he built there an altar : and called upon the name of the Lord , and pitched his tent ; and commanded his servants to dig a well .
To which place when Abimelech , and <unk> his friend , and <unk> chief captain of his soldiers , came from Gerara ,
Isaac said to them : Why are ye come to me , a man whom you hate , and have thrust out from you ?
And they answered : We saw that the Lord is with thee , and therefore we said : Let there be an oath between us , and let us make a covenant ,
That thou do us no harm , as we on our part have touched nothing of thine , nor have done any thing to hurt thee ; but with peace have sent thee away , increased with the blessing of the Lord .
And he made them a feast , and after they had eaten and drunk :
<unk> in the morning , they swore one to another : and Isaac sent them away peaceably to their own home .
And behold , the same day the servants of Isaac came , telling him of a well which they had digged , and saying : We have found water .
Whereupon he called it <unk> : and the name of the city was called Bersabee , even to this day .
And Esau being forty years old , married wives , Judith , the daughter of <unk> , the Hethite , and <unk> , the daughter of <unk> , of the same place .
And they both offended the mind of Isaac and Rebecca .
Genesis Chapter 27 Jacob , by him mother ’ s counsel , <unk> his father ’ s blessing instead of Esau .
And by her is <unk> to fly to his uncle Laban .
Now Isaac was old , and his eyes were dim , and he could not see : and he called Esau , his elder son , and said to him : My son ?
And he answered : Here I am .
And his father said to him , Thou seest that I am old , and know not the day of my death .
Take thy arms , thy <unk> , and bow , and go abroad ; and when thou hast taken something by <unk> ,
Make me a <unk> meat thereof , as thou knowest I like , and bring it that I may eat : and my soul may bless thee , before I die .
And when Rebecca had heard this , and he was gone into the field to fulfil his father ’ s commandment ,
She said to her son Jacob : I heard thy father <unk> with Esau , thy brother , and saying to him :
Bring me of thy <unk> , and make me meats that I may eat , and bless thee in the sight of the Lord , before I die .
Now therefore , my son , follow my counsel :
And go thy way to the flock , bring me two kids of the best , that I may make of them meat for thy father , such as he <unk> eateth .
Which when thou hast brought in , and he hath eaten , he may bless thee before he die .
And he answered her : Thou knowest that Esau , my brother , is a <unk> man , and I am <unk> :
If my father should feel me , and perceive it , I fear lest he will think I would have mocked him , and I shall bring upon me a curse instead of a blessing .
And his mother said to him : Upon me be this curse , my son : only hear thou my voice , and go , fetch me the things which I have said .
He went , and brought , and gave them to his mother .
She dressed meats , such as she knew his father <unk> .
And she put on him very good garments of Esau , which she had at home with her :
And the little skins of the kids she put about his hands , and covered the bare of his neck .
And she gave him the <unk> meat , and delivered him bread that she had baked .
Which when he had carried in , he said : My father ?
But he answered : I hear .
Who art thou , my son ?
And Jacob said : I am Esau , thy firstborn : I have done as thou didst command me : arise , sit and eat of my <unk> , that thy soul may bless me .
I am Esau thy firstborn .... St. Augustine ( <unk> <unk> <unk> , c . 10 ) , <unk> at large upon this place , <unk> Jacob from a lie , because this whole passage was <unk> , as relating to the <unk> which was afterwards to be given to the Gentiles before the carnal Jews , which Jacob by <unk> light might understand .
So far is certain , that the first birthright , both by divine election and by Esau ’ s free <unk> belonged to Jacob : so that if there were any lie in the case , it could be no more than an <unk> and <unk> one .
And Isaac said to his son : How <unk> thou find it so quickly , my son ?
He answered : It was the will of God , that what I sought came quickly in my way :
And Isaac said : Come hither , that I may feel thee , my son , and may prove whether thou be my son Esau , or no .
He came near to his father , and when he had <unk> him , Isaac said : The voice indeed is the voice of Jacob ; but the hands , are the hands of Esau .
And he knew him not , because his <unk> hands made him like to the elder .
Then blessing him ,
He said : Art thou my son Esau ?
He answered : I am .
Then he said : Bring me the meats of thy <unk> , my son , that my soul may bless thee .
And when they were brought , and he had eaten , he offered him wine also , which after he had drunk ,
He said to him : Come near me , and give me a kiss , my son .
He came near , and kissed him .
And immediately as he <unk> the <unk> smell of his garments , blessing him , he said : Behold , the smell of my son is as the smell of a plentiful field , which the Lord hath blessed .
God give thee of the dew of heaven , and of the fatness of the earth , abundance of corn and wine .
And let peoples serve thee , and tribes worship thee : be thou lord of thy brethren , and let thy mother ’ s children bow down before thee .
Cursed be he that curseth thee : and let him that blesseth thee be filled with blessings .
Isaac had scarce ended his words , when , Jacob being now gone out abroad , Esau came ,
And brought in to his father meats , made of what he had taken in <unk> , saying : Arise , my father , and eat of thy son ’ s <unk> ; that thy soul may bless me .
And Isaac said to him : Why !
who art thou ?
He answered : I am thy firstborn son , Esau .
Isaac was struck with fear , and astonished exceedingly ; and <unk> beyond what can be believed , said : Who is he then that even now brought me <unk> that he had taken , and I ate of all before thou camest ?
and I have blessed him , and he shall be blessed .
Esau having heard his father ’ s words , <unk> out with a great cry ; and , being in a <unk> , said : Bless me also , my father .
And he said : Thy brother came deceitfully and got thy blessing .
But he said again : <unk> is his name called Jacob ; for he hath <unk> me lo this second time : My birthright he took away before , and now this second time he hath stolen away my blessing .
And again he said to his father : Hast thou not reserved me also a blessing ?
Jacob .... That is , a <unk> .
Isaac answered : I have appointed him thy lord , and have made all his brethren his servants : I have established him with corn and wine , and after this , what shall I do more for thee , my son ?
And Esau said to him : Hast thou only one blessing , father ?
I beseech thee bless me also .
And when he wept with a loud cry ,
Isaac being moved , said to him : In the fat of the earth , and in the dew of heaven from above ,
Shall thy blessing be .
Thou shalt live by the sword , and shalt serve thy brother : and the time shall come , when thou shalt shake off and loose his yoke from thy neck .
Esau therefore always hated Jacob , for the blessing wherewith his father had blessed him ; and he said in his heart : The days will come of the mourning for my father , and I will kill my brother Jacob .
These things were told to Rebecca : and she sent and called Jacob , her son , and said to him : Behold Esau , thy brother , <unk> to kill thee .
Now therefore , my son , hear my voice , arise and flee to Laban , my brother , to Haran :
And thou shalt dwell with him a few days , till the wrath of thy brother be <unk> ,
And his indignation cease , and he forget the things thou hast done to him : afterwards I will send , and bring thee from thence hither .
Why shall I be deprived of both my sons in one day ?
And Rebecca said to Isaac : I am weary of my life , because of the daughters of Heth : if Jacob take a wife of the stock of this land , I choose not to live .
Genesis Chapter 28 Jacob ’ s journey to Mesopotamia : his vision and vow .
And Isaac called Jacob , and blessed him , and charged him , saying : Take not a wife of the stock of Chanaan :
But go , and take a journey to Mesopotamia of Syria , to the house of <unk> , thy mother ’ s father , and take thee a wife thence of the daughters of Laban , thy uncle .
And God almighty bless thee , and make thee to increase and multiply thee : that thou mayst be a multitude of people .
And give the blessings of <unk> to thee , and to thy seed after thee : that thou mayst possess the land of thy <unk> , which he promised to thy <unk> .
And when Isaac had sent him away , he took his journey and went to Mesopotamia of Syria , to Laban , the son of <unk> , the Syrian , brother to Rebecca , his mother .
And Esau seeing that his father had blessed Jacob , and had sent him into Mesopotamia of Syria , to marry a wife thence ; and that after the blessing he had charged him , saying : Thou shalt not take a wife of the daughters of Chanaan :
And that Jacob <unk> his parents , was gone into Syria :
<unk> also , that his father was not well pleased with the daughters of Chanaan :
He went to Ismael , and took to wife , besides them he had before , <unk> , the daughter of Ismael , Abraham ’ s son , the sister of <unk> .
But Jacob being departed from Bersabee , went on to Haran .
And when he was come to a certain place , and would rest in it after <unk> , he took of the stones that lay there , and putting under his head , slept in the same place .
And he saw in his sleep a <unk> standing upon the earth , and the top thereof touching heaven : the angels also of God <unk> and descending by it .
And the Lord leaning upon the <unk> saying to him : I am the Lord God of Abraham thy father , and the God of Isaac : The land , wherein thou <unk> , I will give to thee and to thy seed .
And thy seed shall be as the dust of the earth : thou shalt spread abroad to the west , and to the east , and to the north , and to the south : and <unk> <unk> and thy seed , all the tribes of the earth <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And I will be thy keeper whithersoever thou goest , and will bring thee back into this land : neither will I leave thee , till I shall have accomplished all that I have said .
And when Jacob awaked out of sleep , he said : <unk> the Lord is in this place , and I knew it not .
And trembling , he said : How terrible is this place ?
this is no other but the house of God , and the gate of heaven .
And Jacob <unk> in the morning , took the stone which he had laid under his head , and set it up for a title , pouring oil upon the top of it .
And he called the name of the city Bethel , which before was called <unk> .
Bethel ....
This name signifies the house of God .
And he made a vow , saying : If God shall be with me , and shall keep me in the way , by which I walk , and shall give me bread to eat , and raiment to put on ,
And I shall return prosperously to my father ’ s house : the Lord shall be my God :
And this stone , which I have set up for a title , shall be called the house of God : and of all things that thou shalt give to me , I will offer tithes to thee .
Genesis Chapter 29 Jacob serveth Laban seven years for Rachel : but is deceived with Lia : he afterwards marrieth Rachel .
Lia <unk> him four sons .
Then Jacob went on in his journey , and came into the east country .
And he saw a well in the field , and three flocks of sheep lying by it : for the beasts were watered out of it , and the mouth thereof was closed with a great stone .
And the custom was , when all the sheep were gathered together , to <unk> away the stone , and after the sheep were watered , to put it on the mouth of the well again .
And he said to the shepherds : Brethren , whence are you ?
They answered : Of Haran .
And he asked them , saying : Know you Laban , the son of Nachor ?
They said : We know him .
He said : Is he in health ?
He is in health , say they : and behold , Rachel , his daughter , cometh with his flock .
And Jacob said : There is yet much day remaining , neither is it time to bring the flocks into the <unk> again : first give the sheep drink , and so lead them back to feed .
They answered : We cannot , till all the cattle be gathered together , and we remove the stone from the well ’ s mouth , that we may water the flocks .
They were yet speaking , and behold Rachel came with her father ’ s sheep ; for she fed the flock .
And when Jacob saw her , and knew her to be his cousin <unk> , and that they were the sheep of Laban , his uncle : he removed the stone wherewith the well was closed .
And having watered the flock , he kissed her : and lifting up his voice wept .
And he told her that he was her father ’ s brother , and the son of Rebecca : but she went in haste and told her father .
29 : 13 . Who , when he heard that Jacob his sister ’ s son was come , ran forth to meet him : and <unk> him , and <unk> <unk> him , brought him into his house .
And when he had heard the causes of his journey ,
He answered : Thou art my bone and my flesh .
And after the days of one month were expired ,
He said to him : Because thou art my brother , shalt thou serve me without wages ?
Tell me what wages thou wilt have .
Now he had two daughters , the name of the elder was Lia ; and the younger was called Rachel .
But Lia was <unk> : Rachel was well <unk> , and of a beautiful countenance .
And Jacob being in love with her , said : I will serve thee seven years for Rachel , thy younger daughter .
Laban answered : It is better that I give her to thee than to another man ; stay with me .
So Jacob served seven years for Rachel : and they seemed but a few days , because of the greatness of his love .
And he said to Laban : Give me my wife ; for now the time is fulfilled , that I may go in unto her .
And he , having invited a great number of his friends to the feast , made the marriage .
And at night he brought in Lia , his daughter , to him ,
<unk> his daughter a handmaid , named <unk> .
Now when Jacob had gone in to her according to custom , when morning was come he saw it was Lia .
And he said to his <unk> : What is it that thou didst mean to do ?
did not I serve thee for Rachel ?
why hast thou deceived me ?
Laban answered : It is not the custom in this place , to give the younger in marriage first .
Make up the week of days of this <unk> : and I will give thee her also , for the service that thou shalt render me other seven years .
He yielded to his pleasure : and after the week was past , he married Rachel :
To whom her father gave Bala , for her servant .
And having at length obtained the marriage he <unk> for , he preferred the love of the latter before the former , and served with him other seven years .
And the Lord seeing that he despised Lia , opened her womb , but her sister remained barren .
And she conceived and bore a son , and called his name Ruben , saying : The Lord saw my affliction : now my husband will love me .
And again she conceived and bore a son , and said : Because the Lord heard that I was despised , he hath given this also to me : and she called his name Simeon .
And she conceived the third time , and bore another son , and said : Now also my husband will be joined to me , because I have borne him three sons : and therefore she called his name Levi .
The fourth time she conceived and bore a son , and said : Now will I praise the Lord : and for this she called him Juda .
And she left bearing .
Genesis Chapter 30 Rachel , being barren , <unk> her handmaid to Jacob ; she beareth two sons .
Lia ceasing to bear , giveth also her handmaid , and she beareth two more .
Then Lia beareth other two sons and one daughter .
Rachel beareth Joseph .
Jacob , desirous to return home , is hired to stay for a certain part of the flock ’ s increase , whereby he becometh exceeding rich .
And Rachel seeing herself without children , <unk> her sister , and said to her husband : Give me children , otherwise I shall die .
And Jacob being angry with her , answered : Am I as God , who hath deprived thee of the fruit of thy womb ?
But she said : I have here my servant Bala : go in unto her , that she may bear upon my knees , and I may have children by her .
And she gave him Bala in marriage : who ,
When her husband had gone in unto her , conceived and bore a son .
And Rachel said : The Lord hath judged for me , and hath heard my voice , giving me a son ; and therefore she called his name Dan .
And again Bala conceived , and bore another ,
For whom Rachel said : God hath compared me with my sister , and I have prevailed : and she called him Nephthali .
Lia <unk> that she had left of bearing , gave <unk> , her handmaid , to her husband .
And when she had conceived , and brought forth a son ,
She said : <unk> .
And therefore called his name Gad .
<unk> also bore another .
And Lia said : This is for my happiness : for women will call me blessed .
Therefore she called him Aser .
And Ruben going out in the time of the wheat harvest into the field , found <unk> : which he brought to his mother Lia .
And Rachel said : Give me part of thy son ’ s <unk> .
She answered : Dost thou think it a small matter , that thou hast taken my husband from me , unless thou take also my son ’ s <unk> ?
Rachel said : He shall sleep with thee this night , for thy son ’ s <unk> .
And when Jacob returned at even from the field , Lia went out to meet him , and said : Thou shalt come in unto me , because I have hired thee for my son ’ s <unk> .
And he slept with her that night .
And God heard her prayers ; and she conceived : and bore a fifth son :
And said : God hath given me a reward , because I gave my handmaid to my husband .
And she called his name Issachar .
And Lia conceived again , and bore the sixth son ,
And said : God hath <unk> me with a good <unk> ; this turn also my husband will be with me , because I have borne him six sons : and therefore she called his name Zabulon .
After whom she bore a daughter , named <unk> .
The Lord also remembering Rachel , heard her , and opened her womb .
And she conceived , and bore a son , saying : God hath taken away my reproach .
And she called his name Joseph : saying : The Lord give me also another son .
And when Joseph was born , Jacob said to his <unk> : Send me away , that I may return into my country , and to my land .
Give me my wives , and my children , for whom I have served thee , that I may depart : thou knowest the service that I have rendered thee .
Laban said to him : Let me find favour in thy sight : I have learned , by experience , that God hath blessed me for thy sake .
<unk> thy wages which I shall give thee .
But he answered : Thou knowest how I have served thee , and how great thy possession hath been in my hands .
Thou hadst but little before I came to thee , and now thou art become rich : and the Lord hath blessed thee at my coming .
It is <unk> , therefore , that I should now provide also for my own house .
And Laban said : What shall I give thee ?
But he said : I require nothing ; but if thou wilt do what I demand , I will feed and keep thy sheep again .
Go round through all thy flocks , and separate all the sheep of divers colours , and <unk> ; and all that is <unk> and spotted , and of divers colours , as well among the sheep as among the goats , shall be my wages .
And my justice shall answer for me tomorrow before thee , when the time of the <unk> shall come ; and all that is not of divers colours , and spotted , and <unk> , as well among the sheep as among the goats , shall accuse me of theft .
And Laban said : I like well what thou <unk> .
And he separated the same day the <unk> , and the sheep , and the <unk> , and the rams of divers colours , and spotted ; and all the flock of one colour , that is , of white and black <unk> , he delivered into the hands of his sons .
And he set the space of three days journey <unk> himself and his <unk> , who fed the rest of his flock .
And Jacob took green rods of <unk> , and of <unk> , and of <unk> , and <unk> them in part : so when the <unk> was taken off , in the parts that were <unk> , there appeared <unk> : but the parts that were whole , remained green : and by this means the colour was divers .
And he put them in the <unk> , where the water was poured out ; that when the flocks should come to drink , they might have the rods before their eyes , and in the sight of them might conceive .
And it came to pass , that in the very heat of <unk> , the sheep beheld the rods , and brought forth spotted , and of divers colours , and <unk> .
And Jacob separated the flock , and put the rods in the <unk> before the eyes of the rams ; and all the white and the black were Laban ’ s , and the rest were Jacob ’ s , when the flocks were separated one from the other .
So when the <unk> went first to ram , Jacob put the rods in the <unk> of water before the eyes of the rams , and of the <unk> , that they might conceive while they were looking upon them .
But when the <unk> coming was , and the last <unk> , he did not put them .
And those that were <unk> , became Laban ’ s ; and they of the first time , Jacob ’ s .
And the man was enriched exceedingly , and he had many flocks , <unk> and <unk> , camels and asses .
Genesis Chapter 31 Jacob ’ s <unk> : he is pursued and <unk> by Laban .
They make a covenant .
But after that he had heard the words of the sons of Laban , saying : Jacob hath taken away all that was our father ’ s , and being enriched by his substance is become great .
And <unk> also , that Laban ’ s countenance was not towards him as yesterday and the other day .
<unk> the Lord saying to him : Return into the land of thy fathers and to thy kindred , and I will be with thee .
He sent , and called Rachel and Lia into the field , where he fed the flocks ,
And said to them : I see your father ’ s countenance is not towards me as yesterday and the other day : but the God of my father hath been with me .
And you know that I have served your father to the uttermost of my power .
Yea your father hath also <unk> me , and hath changed my wages ten times : and yet God hath not suffered him to hurt me .
If at any time , he said : The <unk> shall be thy wages : all the sheep brought forth <unk> : but when he said on the contrary : Thou shalt take all the white one for thy wages : all the flocks brought forth white ones .
And God hath taken your father ’ s substance , and given it to me .
For after the time came of the <unk> <unk> , I lifted up my eyes , and saw in my sleep , that the males which leaped upon the <unk> were of divers colours , and spotted , and <unk> .
And the angel of God said to me in my sleep : Jacob .
And I answered : Here I am .
And he said : Lift up thy eyes , and see that all the males <unk> upon the <unk> , are of divers colours , spotted and <unk> .
For I have seen all that Laban hath done to thee .
I am the God of Bethel , where thou didst anoint the stone , and make a vow to me .
Now therefore arise , and go out of this land , and return into thy native country .
And Rachel and Lia answered : Have we any thing left among the goods and inheritance of our father ’ s house ?
Hath he not counted us as strangers , and sold us , and eaten up the price of us ?
But God hath taken our father ’ s riches , and delivered them to us , and to our children : wherefore , do all that God hath commanded thee .
Then Jacob rose up , and having set his children and wives upon camels , went his way .
And he took all his substance , and flocks , and whatsoever he had gotten in Mesopotamia , and went forward to Isaac , his father , to the land of Chanaan .
At that time Laban was gone to <unk> his sheep , and Rachel stole away her father ’ s idols .
Her father ’ s idols .... By this it appears that Laban was an <unk> ; and some of the fathers are of opinion that Rachel stole away these idols to withdraw him from idolatry , <unk> the occasion of his sin .
And Jacob would not confess to his <unk> that he was flying away .
And when he was gone , together with all that belonged to him , and having passed the river , was going on towards mount Galaad ,
It was told Laban on the third day , that Jacob fled .
And he took his brethren with him , and pursued after him seven days ; and <unk> him in the mount of Galaad .
And he saw in a dream God , saying to him : Take heed thou speak not any thing <unk> against Jacob .
Now Jacob had pitched his tent in the mountain : and when he , with his brethren , had <unk> him , he pitched his tent in the same mount of Galaad .
And he said to Jacob : Why hast thou done thus , to carry away , without my knowledge , my daughters as captives taken with the sword ?
Why wouldst thou run away privately , and not <unk> me , that I might have brought thee on the way with joy , and with <unk> , and with timbrels , and with harps ?
Thou hast not suffered me to kiss my sons and daughters ; thou hast done foolishly ; and now indeed ,
It is in my power to return thee evil ; but the God of your father said to me yesterday : Take heed thou speak not any thing <unk> against Jacob .
<unk> thou didst desire to go to thy friends , and hadst a <unk> after thy father ’ s house : why hast thou stolen away my gods ?
Jacob answered : That I departed unknown to thee , it was for fear lest thou wouldst take away thy daughters by force .
But , whereas , thou <unk> me with theft : with whomsoever thou shalt find thy gods , let him be slain before our brethren .
<unk> , and if thou find any of thy things with me , take them away .
Now when he said this , he knew not that Rachel had stolen the idols .
So Laban went into the tent of Jacob , and of Lia , and of both the handmaids , and found them not .
And when he was entered into Rachel ’ s tent ,
She , in haste , hid the idols under the camel ’ s furniture , and sat upon them : and when he had searched all the tent , and found nothing ,
She said : Let not my lord be angry that I cannot rise up before thee , because it has now happened to me according to the custom of women .
So his careful search was in vain .
And Jacob being angry , said in a <unk> manner : For what fault of mine , and for what offence on my part hast thou so <unk> pursued me ,
And searched all my household <unk> ?
What hast thou found of all the substance of thy house ?
lay it here before my brethren , and thy brethren , and let them judge between me and thee .
Have I , therefore , been with thee twenty years ?
thy <unk> and goats were not barren , the rams of thy flocks I did not eat :
Neither did I shew thee that which the beast had torn ; I made good all the damage : whatsoever was lost by theft , thou didst exact it of me :
<unk> and night was I <unk> with heat , and with frost , and sleep departed from my eyes .
And in this manner have I served thee in thy house twenty years , fourteen for thy daughters , and six for thy flocks : thou hast changed also my wages ten times .
Unless the God of my father , Abraham , and the fear of Isaac , had stood by me , <unk> now thou hadst sent me away naked : God beheld my affliction and the labour of my hands , and rebuked thee yesterday .
Laban answered him : The daughters are mine , and the children , and thy flocks , and all things that thou seest are mine : what can I do to my children , and <unk> ?
Come , therefore , let us enter into a league ; that it may be for a testimony between me and thee .
And Jacob took a stone , and set it up for a title .
And he said to his brethren : Bring hither stones .
And they , gathering stones together , made a heap , and they ate upon it .
And Laban called it , The witness heap ; and Jacob , The <unk> of testimony : each of them according to the <unk> of his language .
And Laban said : This heap shall be a witness between me and thee this day , and therefore the name thereof was called Galaad , that is , The witness heap .
The Lord behold and judge between us , when we shall be gone one from the other .
If thou afflict my daughters , and if thou bring in other wives over them : none is witness of our speech but God , who is present and beholdeth .
And he said again to Jacob : Behold this heap , and the stone which I have set up between me and thee ,
Shall be a witness : this heap , I say , and the stone , be they for a testimony , if either I shall pass beyond it going towards thee , or thou shalt pass beyond it thinking harm to me .
The God of Abraham , and the God of Nachor , the God of their father , judge between us .
And Jacob swore by the fear of his father Isaac :
And after he had offered sacrifices in the mountain , he called his brethren to eat bread .
And when they had eaten , they lodged there :
But Laban arose in the night , and kissed his sons and daughters , and blessed them : and returned to his place .
Genesis Chapter 32 Jacob ’ s vision of angels ; his <unk> and presents to Esau ; his <unk> with an angel .
Jacob also went on the journey he had begun : and the angels of God met him .
And when he saw them , he said : These are the <unk> of God , and he called the name of that place <unk> , that is , <unk> .
And he sent messengers before him to Esau , his brother , to the land of Seir , to the country of Edom :
And he commanded them , saying : Thus shall ye speak to my lord Esau : Thus saith thy brother Jacob : I have sojourned with Laban , and have been with him until this day :
I have oxen , and asses , and sheep , and <unk> , and <unk> : and now I send a <unk> to my lord , that I may find favour in thy sight .
And the messengers returned to Jacob , saying : We came to Esau , thy brother , and behold he cometh with speed to meet thee with four hundred men .
Then Jacob was greatly afraid ; and in his fear divided the people that was with him , and the flocks , and the sheep , and the oxen , and the camels , into two companies ,
Saying : If Esau come to one company , and destroy it , the other company that is left , shall escape .
And Jacob said : O God of my father Abraham , and God of my father Isaac : O Lord who saidst to me , Return to thy land , and to the place of thy birth , and I will do well for thee .
I am not worthy of the least of all thy mercies , and of thy truth which thou hast fulfilled to thy servant .
With my staff I passed over this Jordan ; and now I return with two companies .
Deliver me from the hand of my brother Esau , for I am greatly afraid of him ; lest perhaps he come , and kill the mother with the children .
Thou didst say , that thou wouldst do well by me , and multiply my seed like the sand of the sea , which cannot be numbered for multitude .
And when he had slept there that night , he set apart , of the things which he had , presents for his brother Esau ,
Two hundred <unk> , twenty <unk> , two hundred <unk> , and twenty rams ,
<unk> <unk> camels with their <unk> , forty kine , and twenty <unk> , twenty <unk> , and ten of their <unk> .
And he sent them by the hands of his servants , every drove by itself , and he said to his servants : Go before me , and let there be a space between drove and drove .
And he commanded the first , saying : If thou meet my brother Esau , and he ask thee : Whose art thou ?
or whither goest thou ?
or whose are these before thee ?
Thou shalt answer : Thy servant Jacob ’ s : he hath sent them as a present to my lord Esau ; and he cometh after us .
In like manner he commanded the second , and the third , and all that followed the <unk> , saying : Speak ye the same words to Esau , when ye find him .
And ye shall add : Thy servant Jacob himself also followeth after us ; for he said : I will <unk> him with the presents that go before , and afterwards I will see him , perhaps he will be gracious to me .
So the presents went before him , but himself lodged that night in the camp .
And rising early , he took his two wives and his two handmaids , with his eleven sons , and passed over the <unk> of <unk> .
And when all things were brought over that belonged to him ,
He remained alone ; and behold , a man <unk> with him till morning .
A man , etc ....
This was an angel in human shape , as we learn from Osee <unk> .
He is called God , ver .
28 and 30 , because he <unk> the person of the Son of God .
This <unk> , in which Jacob , <unk> by God , was a <unk> for an angel , was so ordered ( ver .
28 , ) that he might learn by this <unk> of the divine assistance , that neither Esau , nor any other man , should have power to hurt him . — It was also spiritual , as appeareth by his earnest prayer , <unk> and at last <unk> the angel ’ s blessing .
And when he saw that he could not overcome him , he touched the <unk> of his thigh , and forthwith it <unk> .
And he said to him : Let me go , for it is break of day .
He answered : I will not let thee go , except thou bless me .
And he said : What is thy name ?
He answered : Jacob .
But he said : Thy name shall not be called Jacob , but Israel ; for if thou hast been strong against God , how much more shalt thou prevail against men ?
Jacob asked him : Tell me by what name art thou called ?
He answered : Why dost thou ask my name ?
And he blessed him in the same place .
And Jacob called the name of the place Phanuel , saying : I have seen God face to face , and my soul has been saved .
Phanuel ....
This word signifies the face of God , or the sight , or seeing of God .
And immediately the sun rose upon him , after he was past Phanuel ; but he <unk> on his foot .
Therefore the children of Israel , unto this day , eat not the <unk> , that <unk> in Jacob ’ s thigh : because he touched the <unk> of his thigh and it <unk> .
Genesis Chapter 33 Jacob and Esau meet : Jacob goeth to <unk> , where he <unk> an altar .
And Jacob lifting up his eyes , saw Esau coming , and with him four hundred men : and he divided the children of Lia and of Rachel , and of the two handmaids .
And he put both the handmaids and their children <unk> : and Lia and her children in the second place : and Rachel and Joseph last .
And he went forward and bowed down with his face to the ground seven times , until his brother came near .
Then Esau ran to meet his brother , and <unk> him : and <unk> him fast about the neck , and <unk> him , wept .
And lifting up his eyes , he saw the women and their children , and said : What mean these ?
And do they belong to thee ?
He answered : They are the children which God hath given to me , thy servant .
Then the handmaids and their children came near and bowed themselves .
Lia also , with her children , came near and bowed down in like manner ; and last of all , Joseph and Rachel bowed down .
And Esau said : What are the <unk> that I met ?
He answered : That I might find favour before my lord .
But he said : I have plenty , my brother , keep what is thine for thyself .
And Jacob said : Do not so I beseech thee , but if I have found favour in thy eyes , receive a little present at my hands : for I have seen thy face , as if I should have seen the countenance of God : be gracious to me ,
And take the blessing which I have brought thee , and which God hath given me , who giveth all things .
He took it with much <unk> at his brother ’ s earnest <unk> him ,
And said : Let us go on together , and I will <unk> thee in thy journey .
And Jacob said : My lord , thou knowest that I have with me tender children , and sheep , and kine with young : which if I should cause to be <unk> , in one day all the flocks will die .
May it please my lord to go before his servant : and I will follow <unk> after him , as I shall see my children to be able , until I come to my lord in Seir .
Esau answered : I beseech thee , that some of the people , at least , who are with me , may stay to <unk> thee in the way .
And he said : There is no necessity : I want nothing else but only to find favour , my lord , in thy sight .
So Esau returned that day , the way that he came , to Seir .
And Jacob came to <unk> : where having built a house , and pitched tents , he called the name of the place <unk> , that is , <unk> .
And he passed over to <unk> , a city of the <unk> , which is in the land of Chanaan , after he returned from Mesopotamia of Syria : and he dwelt by the town .
And he bought that part of the field , in which he pitched his tents , of the children of Hemor , the father of Sichem , for a hundred lambs .
And <unk> an altar there , he invoked upon it the most mighty God of Israel .
Genesis Chapter 34 <unk> is <unk> , for which the <unk> are destroyed .
And <unk> the daughter of Lia went out to see the women of that country .
And when Sichem the son of Hemor the Hevite , the prince of that land , saw her , he was in love with her : and took her away , and lay with her , <unk> the virgin .
And his soul was fast <unk> unto her ; and whereas she was sad , he comforted her with sweet words .
And going to Hemor his father , he said : Get me this damsel to wife .
But when Jacob had heard this , his sons being absent , and employed in feeding the cattle , he held his peace till they came back .
And when Hemor the father of Sichem was come out to speak to Jacob ,
Behold his sons came from the field : and hearing what had passed , they were exceeding angry , because he had done a <unk> thing in Israel , and committed an unlawful act , in <unk> Jacob ’ s daughter .
And Hemor spoke to them : The soul of my son Sichem has a <unk> for your daughter : give her him to wife :
And let us <unk> <unk> one with another : give us your daughters , and take you our daughters .
And dwell with us : the land is at your command , till , <unk> , and possess it .
Sichem also said to her father and to her brethren : Let me find favour in your sight , and whatsoever you shall appoint I will give :
<unk> the <unk> , and ask gifts , and I will <unk> give what you shall demand : only give me this damsel to wife .
The sons of Jacob answered Sichem and his father deceitfully , being <unk> at the <unk> of their sister : <unk> ....
The sons of Jacob , on this occasion , were guilty of a grievous sin , as well by falsely <unk> religion , as by excess of revenge : though otherwise their zeal against so <unk> a crime was <unk> .
We cannot do what you demand , nor give our sister to one that is uncircumcised ; which with us is unlawful and abominable .
But in this we may be <unk> with you , if you will be like us , and all the male sex among you be circumcised :
Then will we <unk> give and take your daughters , and ours ; and we will dwell with you , and will be one people :
But if you will not be circumcised , we will take our daughter and depart .
Their offer pleased Hemor , and Sichem , his son :
And the young man made no delay , but forthwith fulfilled what was required : for he loved the damsel exceedingly , and he was the greatest man in all his father ’ s house .
And going into the gate of the city , they spoke to the people :
These men are peaceable , and are willing to dwell with us : let them <unk> in the land , and till it , which being large and wide wanteth men to till it : we shall take their daughters for wives , and we will give them ours .
One thing there is for which so great a good is <unk> : We must <unk> every male among us , following the manner of the nation .
And their substance , and cattle , and all that they possess , shall be ours ; only in this let us <unk> , and by dwelling together , we shall make one people .
And they all agreed , and circumcised all the males .
And behold the third day , when the pain of the wound was greatest : two of the sons of Jacob , Simeon and Levi , the <unk> of <unk> , taking their swords , entered boldly into the city and slew all the men .
And they killed also Hemor and Sichem , and took away their sister <unk> out of Sichem ’ s house .
And when they were gone out , the other sons of Jacob came upon the slain ; and <unk> the city in revenge of the <unk> .
And they took their sheep , and their herds , and their asses , <unk> all they had in their houses and in their fields .
And their children and wives they took captive .
And when they had boldly <unk> these things , Jacob said to Simeon and Levi : You have troubled me , and made me hateful to the Chanaanites and <unk> , the inhabitants of this land .
We are few : they will gather themselves together and kill me ; and both I , and my house shall be destroyed .
They answered : <unk> they abuse our sister as a <unk> ?
Genesis Chapter 35 Jacob <unk> his family from idols : goeth by God ’ s commandment to Bethel , and there buildeth an altar .
God appearing again to Jacob blesseth him , and <unk> his name into Israel .
Rachel dieth in <unk> .
Isaac also dieth .
In the mean time God said to Jacob : Arise and go up to Bethel , and dwell there , and make there an altar to God , who appeared to thee when thou didst flee from Esau , thy brother .
And Jacob having called together all his household , said : Cast away the strange gods that are among you , and be cleansed , and change your garments .
Arise , and let us go up to Bethel , that we may make there an altar to God ; who heard me in the day of my affliction , and <unk> me in my journey .
So they gave him all the strange gods they had , and the earrings which were in their ears : and he buried them under the <unk> tree , that is behind the city of Sichem .
And when they were departed , the terror of God fell upon all the cities round about , and they durst not pursue after them as they went away .
And Jacob came to <unk> , which is in the land of Chanaan , surnamed Bethel : he and all the people that were with him .
And he built there an altar , and called the name of that place , The house of God : for there God appeared to him when he fled from his brother .
At the same time <unk> , the nurse of Rebecca , died , and was buried at the foot of Bethel , under an oak , and the name of that place was called , The oak of weeping .
And God appeared again to Jacob , after he returned from Mesopotamia of Syria , and he blessed him ,
Saying : Thou shalt not be called any more Jacob , but Israel shall be thy name .
And he called him Israel .
Israel ....
This name signifieth one that <unk> with God .
And said to him : I am God almighty , increase thou and be multiplied .
<unk> and peoples of nations shall be from thee , and kings shall come out of thy loins .
And the land which I gave to Abraham and Isaac , I will give to thee , and to thy seed after thee .
And he departed from him .
But he set up a monument of stone , in the place where God had spoken to him : pouring <unk> upon it , and pouring oil thereon :
And calling the name of that place Bethel .
And going forth from thence , he came in the spring time to the land which leadeth to Ephrata : wherein when Rachel was in <unk> ,
By reason of her hard labour , she began to be in danger , and the <unk> said to her : Fear not , for thou shalt have this son also .
And when her soul was departing for pain , and death was now at hand , she called the name of her son <unk> , that is , the son of my pain : but his father called him Benjamin , that is , the son of the right hand .
So Rachel died , and was buried in the <unk> that leadeth to Ephrata , this is Bethlehem .
And Jacob erected a pillar over her sepulchre : this is the pillar of Rachel ’ s monument , to this day .
<unk> thence , he pitched his tent beyond the <unk> tower .
And when he dwelt in that country , Ruben went , and slept with Bala the concubine of his father : which he was not ignorant of .
Now the sons of Jacob were twelve .
The concubine .... She was his lawful wife ; but , according to the <unk> of the Hebrews , is called concubine , because of her servile <unk> .
The sons of Lia : Ruben the first born , and Simeon , and Levi , and Juda , and Issachar , and Zabulon .
The sons of Rachel : Joseph and Benjamin .
The sons of Bala , Rachel ’ s handmaid : Dan and Nephthali .
The sons of <unk> , Lia ’ s handmaid : Gad and Aser : these are the sons of Jacob , that were born to him in Mesopotamia of Syria .
And he came to Isaac his father in Mambre , the city of <unk> , this is Hebron : wherein Abraham and Isaac sojourned .
And the days of Isaac were a hundred and eighty years .
And being spent with age he died , and was gathered to his people , being old and full of days : and his sons Esau and Jacob buried him .
Genesis Chapter 36 Esau with his wives and children <unk> from Jacob .
An account of his <unk> , and of the first kings of Edom .
And these are the generations of Esau , the same is Edom .
Esau took wives of the daughters of Chanaan : <unk> the daughter of <unk> the Hethite , and <unk> the daughter of Ana , the daughter of <unk> the Hevite : <unk> ....

And Esau took his wives , and his sons and daughters , and every soul of his house , and his substance , and cattle , and all that he was able to <unk> in the land of Chanaan : and went into another country , and departed from his brother Jacob .
For they were exceeding rich , and could not dwell together : neither was the land in which they sojourned able to bear them , for the multitude of their flocks .
And Esau dwelt in mount Seir : he is Edom .
And these are the generations of Esau , the father of Edom , in mount Seir .

These were dukes of the sons of Esau : the sons of Eliphaz , the firstborn of Esau : duke Theman , duke <unk> , duke <unk> , duke Cenez ,
<unk> Core , duke <unk> , duke <unk> : these are the sons of Eliphaz , in the land of Edom , and these the sons of <unk> .
And these were the sons of <unk> , the son of Esau : duke <unk> , duke Zara , duke Samma , duke <unk> .
And these are the dukes of <unk> , in the land of Edom : these the sons of <unk> , the wife of Esau .
And these the sons of <unk> , the wife of Esau : duke <unk> , duke <unk> , duke Core .
These are the dukes of <unk> , the daughter of Ana , and wife of Esau .
These are the sons of Esau , and these the dukes of them : the same is Edom .
These are the sons of Seir , the <unk> , the inhabitants of the land : <unk> , and Sobal , and <unk> , and Ana ,
And <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> .
These are dukes of the <unk> , the sons of Seir , in the land of Edom .
And <unk> had sons : <unk> and Heman .
And the sister of <unk> was <unk> .
And these the sons of Sobal : <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> .

Genesis Chapter 37 Joseph ’ s dreams : he is sold by his brethren , and carried into Egypt .
And Jacob dwelt in the land of Chanaan , wherein his father sojourned .
And these are his generations : Joseph , when he was sixteen years old , was feeding the flock with his brethren , being but a boy : and he was with the sons of Bala and of <unk> his father ’ s wives : and he accused his brethren to his father of a most wicked crime .
Now Israel loved Joseph above all his sons , because he had him in his old age : and he made him a coat of divers colours .
And his brethren seeing that he was loved by his father , more than all his sons , hated him , and could not speak peaceably to him .
Now it fell out also that he told his brethren a dream , that he had dreamed : which <unk> them to hate him the more .
A dream ....
These dreams of Joseph were <unk> , and sent from God ; as were also those which he interpreted , Gen. <unk> and 41 . ; otherwise <unk> speaking , the <unk> of dreams is condemned in the <unk> , as <unk> and sinful .
See Deut .
<unk> ; <unk> .
<unk> .
And he said to them : Hear my dream which I dreamed .
I thought we were binding <unk> in the field : and my <unk> arose as it were , and stood , and your <unk> standing about bowed down before my <unk> .
His brethren answered : <unk> thou be our king ?
or shall we be subject to thy dominion ?
Therefore this matter of his dreams and words ministered <unk> to their envy and hatred .
He dreamed also another dream , which he told his brethren , saying : I saw in a dream , as it were the sun , and the moon , and eleven stars worshipping me .
And when he had told this to his father , and brethren , his father rebuked him and said : What meaneth this dream that thou hast dreamed ?
shall I and thy mother , and thy brethren worship thee upon the earth ?
<unk> ....
This word is not used here to signify divine worship , but an inferior <unk> , expressed by the bowing of the body , and that , according to the manner of the <unk> nations , down to the ground .
His brethren therefore <unk> him : but his father considered the thing with himself .
And when his brethren abode in <unk> , feeding their father ’ s flocks ,
Israel said to him : Thy brethren feed the sheep in Sichem : come , I will send thee to them .
And when he answered :
I am ready : he said to him : Go , and see if all things be well with thy brethren , and the cattle : and bring me word again what is doing .
So being sent from the vale of Hebron , he came to Sichem :
And a man found him there wandering in the field , and asked what he sought .
But he answered : I seek my brethren , tell me where they feed the flocks .
And the man said to him : They are departed from this place : for I heard them say : Let us go to <unk> .
And Joseph went forward after his brethren , and found them in <unk> .
And when they saw him afar off , before he came nigh them , they thought to kill him :
And said one to another : Behold the <unk> cometh .
Come , let us kill him , and cast him into some old pit : and we will say : Some evil beast hath devoured him : and then it shall appear what his dreams <unk> him :
And Ruben hearing this , <unk> to deliver him out of their hands , and said :
Do not take away his life , nor shed his blood : but cast him into this pit , that is in the wilderness , and keep your hands <unk> : now he said this , being desirous to deliver him out of their hands and to restore him to his father .
And as soon as he came to his brethren , they forthwith <unk> him of his outside coat , that was of divers colours :
And cast him into an old pit where there was not water .
And sitting down to eat bread , they saw some <unk> on their way coming from Galaad , with their camels , carrying spices , and <unk> , and myrrh to Egypt .
And Juda said to his brethren : What will it profit us to kill our brother , and <unk> his blood ?
It is better that he be sold to the <unk> , and that our hands be not defiled : for he is our brother and our flesh .
His brethren agreed to his words .
And when the <unk> merchants passed by , they drew him out of the pit , and sold him to the <unk> , for twenty pieces of silver : and they led him into Egypt .
And Ruben returning to the pit , found not the boy :
And <unk> his garments he went to his brethren , and said : The boy doth not appear , and whither shall I go ?
And they took his coat , and <unk> it in the blood of a kid , which they had killed :
<unk> some to carry it to their father , and to say : This we have found : see whether it be thy son ’ s coat , or not .
And the father <unk> it , said : It is my son ’ s coat , an evil wild beast hath eaten him , a beast hath devoured Joseph .
And <unk> his garments , he put on sackcloth , mourning for his son a long time .
And all his children being gathered together to comfort their father in his sorrow , he would not receive comfort , but said : I will go down to my son into hell , mourning .
And whilst he continued weeping , Into hell .... That is , into <unk> , the place where the souls of the just were received before the death of our Redeemer .
For <unk> that the word hell sometimes is taken for the grave , it cannot be so taken in this place ; since Jacob did not believe his son to be in the grave , ( whom he supposed to be devoured by a wild beast , ) and therefore could not mean to go down to him thither : but certainly meant the place of rest where he believed his soul to be .
The Madianites sold Joseph in Egypt to <unk> , an eunuch of Pharao , captain of the soldiers .
An eunuch ....
This word sometimes signifies a <unk> , <unk> , or <unk> of the king : and so it is taken in this place .
Genesis Chapter 38 The sons of Juda : the death of Her and <unk> : the birth of Phares and Zara .
At that time Juda went down from his brethren , and turned in to a certain <unk> , named <unk> .
And he saw there the daughter of a man of Chanaan , called <unk> : and taking her to wife , he went in unto her .
And she conceived , and bore a son , and called his name Her .
And <unk> again , she bore a son , and called him <unk> .
She bore also a third : whom she called <unk> .
After whose birth , she ceased to bear any more .
And Juda took a wife for Her , his first born , whose name was Thamar .
And Her , the first born of Juda , was wicked in the sight of the Lord : and was slain by him .
Juda , therefore , said to <unk> his son : Go in to thy brother ’ s wife and marry her , that thou mayst raise seed to thy brother .
He knowing that the children should not be his , when he went in to his brother ’ s wife , he <unk> his seed upon the ground , lest children should be born in his brother ’ s name .
And therefore the Lord slew him , because he did a <unk> thing :
Wherefore Juda said to Thamar his <unk> : <unk> a widow in thy father ’ s house , till <unk> my son grow up : for he was afraid lest he also might die , as his brethren did .
She went her way , and dwelt in her father ’ s house .
And after many days were past : the daughter of <unk> the wife of Juda died : and when he had taken comfort after his mourning , he went up to <unk> , to the <unk> of his sheep , he and <unk> the <unk> , the shepherd of his flock .
And it was told Thamar that her <unk> was come up to <unk> to <unk> his sheep .
And she put off the garments of her <unk> , and took a veil : and <unk> her dress , sat in the cross way , that leadeth to <unk> : because <unk> was grown up , and she had not been married to him .
When Juda saw her , he thought she was a harlot : for she had covered her face , lest she should be known .
And going to her , he said : Suffer me to lie with thee : for he knew her not to be his <unk> .
And she answered : What wilt thou give me to enjoy my company ?
He said : I will send thee a kid out of the flock .
And when she said again : I will suffer what thou wilt , if thou give me a pledge , till thou send what thou <unk> .
Juda said : What wilt thou have for a pledge ?
She answered : Thy ring and <unk> , and the staff which thou <unk> in thy hand .
The woman therefore at one <unk> conceived .
And she arose and went her way : and putting off the apparel which she had taken , put on the garments of her <unk> .
And Juda sent a kid by his shepherd , the <unk> , that he might receive the pledge again , which he had given to the woman : but he , not finding her ,
<unk> the men of that place : Where is the woman that sat in the cross way ?
And when they all made answer : There was no harlot in this place ,
He returned to Juda , and said to him : I have not found her ; moreover , the men of that place said to me , that there never sat a harlot there .
Juda said : Let her take it to herself , surely she cannot charge us with a lie , I sent the kid which I promised : and thou didst not find her .
And behold , after three months , they told Juda , saying : Thamar , thy <unk> , hath played the harlot , and she appeareth to have a <unk> belly .
And Juda said : Bring her out that she may be burnt .
But when she was led to <unk> , she sent to her father in law , saying : By the man , to whom these things belong , I am with child .
See whose ring , and <unk> , and staff this is .
But he <unk> the gifts , said : She is <unk> than I : because I did not give her to <unk> , my son .
However he knew her no more .
And when she was ready to be brought to bed , there appeared <unk> in her womb : and in the very delivery of the infants , one put forth a hand , <unk> the <unk> tied a scarlet <unk> , saying :
This shall come forth the first .
But he drawing back his hand , the other came forth : and the woman said : Why is the <unk> divided for thee ?
and therefore called his name Phares .
Phares .... That is , a breach or division .
<unk> his brother came out , on whose hand was the scarlet <unk> : and she called his name Zara .
Genesis Chapter 39 Joseph hath charge of his master ’ s house : <unk> his mistress ’ s <unk> : is falsely accused by her , and cast into prison , where he hath the charge of all the prisoners .
And Joseph was brought into Egypt , and <unk> , an eunuch of Pharao , chief captain of the army , an Egyptian , bought him of the <unk> , by whom he was brought .
And the Lord was with him , and he was a prosperous man in all things : and he dwelt in his master ’ s house : 39 : 3 . Who knew very well that the Lord was with him , and made all that he did to prosper in his hand .
And Joseph found favour in the sight of his master , and ministered to him : and being set over all by him , he <unk> the house committed to him , and all things that were delivered to him :
And the Lord blessed the house of the Egyptian for Joseph ’ s sake , and multiplied all his substance , both at home and in the fields .
Neither knew he any other thing , but the bread which he ate .
And Joseph was of a beautiful countenance , and comely to behold .
And after many days , his mistress cast her eyes on Joseph , and said : <unk> with me .
But he in no wise <unk> to that wicked act said to her : Behold , my master hath delivered all things to me , and knoweth not what he hath in his own house :
Neither is there any thing which is not in my power , or that he hath not delivered to me , but thee , who art his wife ; how then can I do this wicked thing , and sin against my God ?
With such words as these day by day , both the woman was <unk> with the young man , and he refused the adultery .
Now it happened on a certain day , that Joseph went into the house , and was doing some business , without any man with him :
And she <unk> the <unk> of his garment , said : <unk> with me .
But he leaving the garment in her hand , fled , and went out .
And when the woman saw the garment in her hands , and herself <unk> ,
She called to her the men of her house , and said to them : See , he hath brought in a Hebrew , to abuse us : he came in to me , to lie with me ; and when I cried out ,
And he heard my voice , he left the garment that I held , and got him out .
For a proof therefore of her fidelity , she kept the garment , and shewed it to her husband when he returned home : A proof of her fidelity .... or an <unk> to gain credit , <unk> <unk> .
And said : The Hebrew servant , whom thou hast brought , came to me to abuse me .
And when he heard me cry , he left the garment which I held , and fled out .
His master hearing these things , and giving too much credit to his wife ’ s words , was very angry ,
And cast Joseph into the prison , where the king ’ s prisoners were kept , and he was there shut up .
But the Lord was with Joseph , and having mercy upon him gave him favour in the sight of the chief keeper of the prison : 39 : 22 . Who delivered into his hand all the prisoners that were kept in <unk> : and whatsoever was done , was under him .
Neither did he himself know any thing , having committed all things to him : for the Lord was with him , and made all that he did to prosper .
Genesis Chapter 40 Joseph <unk> the dreams of two of Pharao ’ s servants in prison : the event <unk> the <unk> to be true , but Joseph is forgotten .
After this , it came to pass , that two eunuchs , the <unk> and the <unk> of the king of Egypt , offended their lord .
And Pharao being angry with them , ( now the one was chief <unk> , the other chief <unk> , )
He sent them to the prison of the <unk> of the soldiers , in which Joseph also was prisoner .
But the keeper of the prison delivered them to Joseph , and he served them .
Some little time passed , and they were kept in <unk> .
And they both dreamed a dream the same night , according to the interpretation <unk> to themselves :
And when Joseph was come into them in the morning , and saw them sad ,
He asked them , saying : Why is your countenance <unk> today than usual ?
They answered : We have dreamed a dream , and there is <unk> to interpret it to us .
And Joseph said to them : Doth not interpretation belong to God ?
Tell me what you have dreamed : Doth not interpretation belong to God ? ....
When dreams are from God , as these were , the interpretation of them is a gift of God .
But the <unk> of dreams are not of this sort ; but either proceed from the natural <unk> and <unk> of persons , or the <unk> of their <unk> in the day on such <unk> as they are much <unk> with , or from their mind being disturbed with cares and troubles , and oppressed with <unk> infirmities : or they are <unk> by evil spirits , to <unk> , or to terrify weak minds , in order to gain belief , and so draw them into error or <unk> ; or at least to trouble them in their sleep , whom they cannot move when they are awake : so that the general rule , with regard to dreams , is not to observe them , nor to give any credit to them .
The chief <unk> first told his dream : I saw before me a vine ,
On which were three branches , which by little and little sent out <unk> , and after the <unk> brought forth ripe grapes :
And the cup of Pharao was in my hand : and I took the grapes , and pressed them into the cup which I held , and I gave the cup to Pharao .
Joseph answered : This is the interpretation of the dream : The three branches , are yet three days :
After which Pharao will remember thy service , and will restore thee to thy former place : and thou shalt present him the cup according to thy office , as before thou was wont to do .
Only remember me when it shall be well with thee , and do me this kindness : to put Pharao in mind to take me out of this prison :
For I was stolen away out of the land of the Hebrews , and here without any fault was cast into the dungeon .
The chief <unk> seeing that he had wisely interpreted the dream , said : I also dreamed a dream , That I had three baskets of meal upon my head :
And that in one basket which was <unk> , I carried all meats that are made by the art of <unk> , and that the birds ate out of it .
Joseph answered : This is the interpretation of the dream : The three baskets , are yet three days :
After which Pharao will take thy head from thee , and hang thee on a cross , and the birds shall tear thy flesh .
The third day after this was the <unk> of Pharao : and he made a great feast for his servants , and at the banquet remembered the chief <unk> , and the chief <unk> .
And he restored the one to his place , to present him the cup :
The other he hanged on a gibbet , that the truth of the <unk> might be shewn .
But the chief <unk> , when things prospered with him , forgot his <unk> .
Genesis Chapter 41 Joseph <unk> the two dreams of Pharao : he is made ruler over all Egypt .
After two years Pharao had a dream .
He thought he stood by the river ,
Out of which came up seven kine , very beautiful and fat : and they fed in <unk> places .
Other seven also came up out of the river , <unk> , and lean <unk> : and they fed on the very bank of the river , in green places :
And they devoured them , whose bodies were very beautiful and well <unk> .
So Pharao <unk> .
He slept again , and dreamed another dream : Seven ears of corn came up upon one <unk> full and fair :
Then seven other ears sprung up <unk> and <unk> ,
And devoured all the beauty of the former .
Pharao awaked after his rest :
And when morning was come , being struck with fear , he sent to all the interpreters of Egypt , and to all the wise men : and they being called for , he told them his dream , and there was not any one that could interpret it .
Then at length the chief <unk> remembering , said : I confess my sin :
The king being angry with his servants , commanded me and the chief <unk> to be cast into the prison of the captain of the soldiers .
Where in one night both of us dreamed a dream <unk> things to come .
There was there a young man a Hebrew , servant to the same captain of the soldiers : to whom we told our dreams ,
And we heard what afterwards the event of the thing proved to be so .
For I was restored to my office : and he was hanged upon a gibbet .
<unk> at the king ’ s command Joseph was brought out of the prison , and they <unk> him : and <unk> his apparel brought him in to him .
And he said to him : I have dreamed dreams , and there is no one that can expound them : Now I have heard that thou art very wise at <unk> them :
Joseph answered : Without me , God shall give Pharao a prosperous answer .
So Pharao told what he had dreamed : <unk> I stood upon the bank of the river ,
And seven kine came up out of the river , exceeding beautiful and full of flesh : and they <unk> on green places in a <unk> pasture .
And behold , there followed these , other seven kine , so very <unk> and lean , that I never saw the like in the land of Egypt :
And they devoured and consumed the former ,
And yet gave no mark of their being full : but were as lean and <unk> as before .
I <unk> , and then fell asleep again ,
And dreamed a dream : Seven ears of corn grew up upon one <unk> , full and very fair .
Other seven also <unk> and <unk> , sprung of the <unk> :
And they devoured the beauty of the former : I told this dream to the <unk> , and there is no man that can expound it .
Joseph answered : The king ’ s dream is one : God hath shewn to Pharao what he is about to do .
The seven beautiful kine , and the seven full ears , are seven years of plenty : and both contain the same meaning of the dream .
And the seven lean and <unk> kine that came up after them , and the seven <unk> ears that were <unk> with the burning wind , are seven years of famine to come :
Which shall be fulfilled in this order .
Behold , there shall come seven years of great plenty in the whole land of Egypt :
After which shall follow other seven years of so great <unk> , that all the abundance before shall be forgotten : for the famine shall consume all the land ,
And the greatness of the <unk> shall destroy the greatness of the plenty .
And for that thou didst see the second time a dream <unk> to the same thing : it is a token of the certainty , and that the word of God cometh to pass , and is fulfilled speedily .
Now therefore let the king provide a wise and <unk> man , and make him ruler over the land of Egypt :
That he may appoint overseers over all the countries : and gather into barns the fifth part of the fruits , during the seven fruitful years ,
That shall now presently <unk> : and let all the corn be laid up , under Pharao ’ s hands , and be reserved in the cities .
And let it be in <unk> , against the famine of seven years to come , which shall oppress Egypt , and the land shall not be consumed with <unk> .
The counsel pleased Pharao , and all his servants .
And he said to them : Can we find such another man , that is full of the spirit of God ?
He said therefore to Joseph : Seeing God hath shewn thee all that thou hast said , can I find one wiser and one like unto thee ?
Thou shalt be over my house , and at the commandment of thy mouth all the people shall obey : only in the <unk> throne will I be above thee .
And again Pharao said to Joseph : Behold , I have appointed thee over the whole land of Egypt .
And he took his ring from his own hand , and gave it into his hand : and he put upon him a robe of <unk> , and put a chain of gold about his neck .
And he made him go up into his second chariot , the <unk> <unk> that all should bow their knee before him , and that they should know he was made governor over the whole land of Egypt .
And the king said to Joseph : I am Pharao : without thy commandment no man shall move hand or foot in all the land of Egypt .
And he turned his name , and called him in the Egyptian tongue the saviour of the world .
And he gave him to wife <unk> , the daughter of <unk> , priest of <unk> .
Then Joseph went out to the land of Egypt .
The saviour of the world .... <unk> <unk> .
( Now he was thirty years old when he stood before king Pharao ) , and he went round all the countries of Egypt .
And the <unk> of the seven years came : and the corn being bound up into <unk> , was gathered together into the barns of Egypt .
And all the abundance of grain was laid up in every city .
And there was so great abundance of wheat , that it was equal to the sand of the sea , and the plenty <unk> measure .
And before the famine came , Joseph had two sons born : whom <unk> , the daughter of <unk> , priest of <unk> , bore unto him .
And he called the name of the firstborn Manasses , saying : God hath made me to forget all my labours , and my father ’ s house .
Manasses .... That is , <unk> , or <unk> .
And he named the second Ephraim , saying : God hath made me to grow in the land of my poverty .
Ephraim .... That is , fruitful , or growing .
Now when the seven years of plenty that had been in Egypt were passed :
The seven years of <unk> , which Joseph had foretold , began to come : and the famine prevailed in the whole world , but there was bread in all the land of Egypt .
And when there also they began to be <unk> , the people cried to Pharao , for food .
And he said to them : Go to Joseph : and do all that he shall say to you .
And the famine increased daily in all the land : and Joseph opened all the barns , and sold to the Egyptians : for the famine had oppressed them also .
And all provinces came into Egypt , to buy food , and to seek some <unk> of their want .
Genesis Chapter 42 Jacob sendeth his ten sons to buy corn in Egypt .
Their <unk> by Joseph .
And Jacob hearing that food was sold in Egypt , said to his sons : Why are ye <unk> ?
I have heard that wheat is sold in Egypt : Go ye down , and buy us necessaries , that we may live , and not be consumed with want .
So the ten brethren of Joseph went down , to buy corn in Egypt :
<unk> Benjamin was kept at home by Jacob , who said to his brethren : Lest perhaps he take any harm in the journey .
And they entered into the land of Egypt with others that went to buy .
For the famine was in the land of Chanaan .
And Joseph was governor in the land of Egypt , and corn was sold by his <unk> to the people .
And when his brethren had bowed down to him ,
And he knew them , he spoke as it were to strangers , somewhat <unk> , asking them : Whence came you ?
They answered : From the land of Chanaan , to buy necessaries of life .
And though he knew his brethren , he was not known by them .
And remembering the dreams , which formerly he had dreamed , he said to them : You are spies .
You are come to view the <unk> parts of the land .
You are spies ....
This he said by way of <unk> them , to see what they would answer .
But they said : It is not so , my lord ; but thy servants are come to buy food .
We are all the sons of one man : we are come as peaceable men , neither do thy servants go about any evil .
And he answered them : It is otherwise : you are come to consider the <unk> parts of this land .
But they said : We thy servants are twelve brethren , the sons of one man in the land of Chanaan : the youngest is with our father , the other is not living .
He saith , This is it that I said : You are spies .
I shall now presently try what you are : by the health of Pharao , you shall not depart hence , until your youngest brother come .
Send one of you to fetch him : and you shall be in prison , till what you have said be proved , whether it be true or false : or else by the health of Pharao you are spies .
Or else by the health of Pharao you are spies .... That is , if these things you say be proved false , you are to be held for spies for your lying , and shall be treated as such .
Joseph dealt in this manner with his brethren , to bring them by the means of affliction to a sense of their former sin , and a sincere repentance for it .
So he put them in prison three days .
And the third day he brought them out of prison , and said : Do as I have said , and you shall live : for I fear God .
If you be peaceable men , let one of your brethren be bound in prison : and go ye your ways , and carry the corn that you have bought , unto your houses .
And bring your youngest brother to me , that I may find your words to be true , and you may not die .
They did as he had said .
And they talked one to another : We deserve to suffer these things , because we have sinned against our brother , seeing the anguish of his soul , when he besought us , and we would not hear : therefore is this affliction come upon us .
And Ruben , one of them , said : Did not I say to you : Do not sin against the boy ; and you would not hear me ?
Behold his blood is required .
And they knew not that Joseph understood , because he spoke to them by an <unk> .
And he turned himself away a little while , and wept : and returning , he spoke to them .
And taking Simeon , and binding him in their presence , he commanded his servants to fill their sacks with wheat , and to put every man ’ s money again in their sacks , and to give them besides provisions for the way : and they did so .
But they having <unk> their asses with the corn went their way .
And one of them opening his <unk> , to give his beast <unk> in the <unk> , saw the money in the <unk> ’ s mouth ,
And said to his brethren : My money is given me again ; behold it is in the <unk> .
And they were astonished , and troubled , and said to one another : What is this that God hath done unto us ?
And they came to Jacob their father in the land of Chanaan , and they told him all things that had befallen them , saying :
The lord of the land spoke <unk> to us , and took us to be spies of the country .
And we answered him : We are peaceable men , and we mean no <unk> .
We are twelve brethren born of one father : one is not living , the youngest is with our father in the land of Chanaan .
And he said to us : <unk> shall I know that you are peaceable men : <unk> one of your brethren with me , and take ye necessary provision for your houses , and go your ways ,
And bring your youngest brother to me , that I may know you are not spies : and you may receive this man again , that is kept in prison : and afterwards may have leave to buy what you will .
When they had told this , they poured out their corn , and every man found his money tied in the mouth of his <unk> : and all being astonished together ,
Their father Jacob said : You have made me to be without children : Joseph is not living , Simeon is kept in bonds , and Benjamin you will take away : all these evils are fallen upon me .
And Ruben answered him : <unk> my two sons , if I bring him not again to thee : deliver him into my hand , and I will restore him to thee .
But he said : My son shall not go down with you : his brother is dead , and he is left alone : if any mischief befall him in the land to which you go , you will bring down my grey hairs with sorrow to hell .
To hell .... That is , to that place , where the souls then remained , as above , chapter <unk> ver .
35 .
Genesis Chapter 43 The sons of Jacob go again into Egypt with Benjamin .
They are <unk> by Joseph .
In the mean time the famine was heavy upon all the land .
And when they had eaten up all the corn , which they had brought out of Egypt , Jacob said to his sons : Go again , and buy us a little food .
Juda answered : The man declared unto us with the <unk> of an oath , saying : You shall not see my face , unless you bring your youngest brother with you .
If therefore thou wilt send him with us , we will set out together , and will buy necessaries for thee .
But if thou wilt not , we will not go : for the man , as we have often said , declared unto us , saying : You shall not see my face without your youngest brother .
Israel said to them : You have done this for my misery , in that you told him you had also another brother .
But they answered : The man asked us in order concerning our kindred : if our father lived : if we had a brother : and we answered him <unk> , according to what he <unk> : could we know that he would say : Bring hither your brother with you ?
And Juda said to his father : Send the boy with me , that we may set forward , and may live : lest both we and our children perish .
I take the boy upon me , require him at my hand : unless I bring him again , and restore him to thee , I will be guilty of sin against thee for ever .
If delay had not been made , we had been here again the second time .
Then Israel said to them : If it must needs be so , do what you will : take of the best fruits of the land in your vessels , and carry down presents to the man , a little <unk> , and honey , and <unk> , myrrh , <unk> , and <unk> .
<unk> ....
Literally <unk> , <unk> ; but here by that name is meant <unk> .
And take with you double money , and carry back what you found in your sacks , lest perhaps it was done by <unk> .
And take also your brother , and go to the man .
And may my almighty God make him <unk> to you : and send back with you your brother , whom he keepeth , and this Benjamin : and as for me I shall be desolate without children .
So the men took the presents , and double money , and Benjamin : and went down into Egypt , and stood before Joseph .
And when he had seen them , and Benjamin with them , he commanded the steward of his house , saying : Bring in the men into the house , and kill victims , and prepare a feast : because they shall eat with me at noon .
He did as he was commanded , and brought the men into the house .
And they being much afraid , said there one to another : Because of the money , which we carried back the first time in our sacks , we are brought in : that he may bring upon us a false accusation , and by violence make slaves of us and our asses .
Wherefore , going up to the steward of the house , at the door ,
They said : Sir , we desire thee to hear us .
We came down once before to buy food :
And when we had bought , and were come to the <unk> , we opened our sacks , and found our money in the mouths of the sacks : which we have now brought again in the same weight .
And we have brought other money besides , to buy what we want : we cannot tell who put it in our <unk> .
But he answered : Peace be with you , fear not : your God , and the God of your father , hath given you treasure in your sacks .
For the money , which you gave me , I have for good .
And he brought Simeon out to them .
And having brought them into the house , he <unk> water , and they washed their feet , and he gave <unk> to their asses .
But they made ready the presents , against Joseph came at noon : for they had heard that they should eat bread there .
Then Joseph came in to his house , and they offered him the presents , holding them in their hands ; and they bowed down with their face to the ground .
But he <unk> <unk> them again , asked them , saying : Is the old man your father in health , of whom you told me ?
Is he yet living ?
And they answered : Thy servant our father , is in health ; he is yet living .
And bowing themselves , they made <unk> to him .
And Joseph lifting up his eyes , saw Benjamin , his brother by the same mother , and said : Is this your young brother , of whom you told me ?
And he said : God be gracious to thee , my son .
And he made haste , because his heart was moved upon his brother , and tears <unk> out : and going into his chamber , he wept .
And when he had washed his face , coming out again , he <unk> himself , and said : Set bread on the table .
And when it was set on , for Joseph apart , and for his brethren apart , for the Egyptians also that ate with him apart , ( for it is unlawful for the Egyptians to eat with the Hebrews , and they think such a feast profane ) :
They sat before him , the firstborn according to his birthright , and the youngest according to his age .
And they wondered very much ;
<unk> the <unk> which they received of him : and the greater <unk> came to Benjamin , so that it <unk> by five parts .
And they drank , and were merry with him .
Genesis Chapter 44 Joseph ’ s <unk> to stop his brethren .
The humble supplication of Juda .
And Joseph commanded the steward of his house , saying : <unk> their sacks with corn , as much as they can hold : and put the money of every one in the top of his <unk> .
And in the mouth of the younger ’ s <unk> put my silver cup , and the price which he gave for the wheat .
And it was so done .
And when the morning arose , they were sent away with their asses .
And when they were now departed out of the city , and had gone forward a little way : Joseph sending for the steward of his house , said : Arise , and pursue after the men : and when thou hast <unk> them , say to them : Why have you returned evil for good ?
The cup which you have stolen , is that in which my lord drinketh , and in which he is wont to divine : you have done a very evil thing .
He did as he had commanded him .
And having <unk> them , he spoke to them the same words .
And they answered : Why doth our lord speak so , as though thy servants had committed so heinous a <unk> ?
The money , that we found in the top of our sacks , we brought back to thee from the land of Chanaan : how then should it be that we should steal out of thy lord ’ s house , gold or silver ?
With whomsoever of thy servants shall be found that which thou <unk> , let him die , and we will be the bondmen of my lord .
And he said to them : Let it be according to your sentence : with whomsoever it shall be found , let him be my servant , and you shall be blameless .
Then they speedily took down their sacks to the ground , and every man opened his <unk> .
Which when he had searched , beginning at the eldest , and <unk> at the youngest , he found the cup in Benjamin ’ s <unk> .
Then they rent their garments , and <unk> their asses again , returned into the town .
And Juda at the head of his brethren went in to Joseph ( for he was not yet gone out of the place ) and they all together fell down before him on the ground .
And he said to them : Why would you do so ?
know you not that there is no one like me in the <unk> of <unk> .
The <unk> of <unk> ....
He speaks of himself according to what he was esteemed in that kingdom .
And indeed , he being truly a prophet , knew more without comparison than any of the Egyptian <unk> .
And Juda said to him : What shall we answer my lord ?
or what shall we say , or be able justly to <unk> ?
God hath found out the iniquity of thy servants : behold , we are all bondmen to my lord , both we , and he with whom the cup was found .
Joseph answered : God forbid that I should do so : he that stole the cup , he shall be my bondman : and go you away free to your father .
Then Juda coming nearer , said boldly : I beseech thee , my lord , let thy servant speak a word in thy ears , and be not angry with thy servant : for after Pharao thou art .
My lord .
Thou didst ask thy servants the first time : Have you a father or a brother .
And we answered thee , my lord : We have a father an old man , and a young boy , that was born in his old age ; whose brother by the mother is dead ; and he alone is left of his mother , and his father loveth him <unk> .
And thou saidst to thy servants : Bring him hither to me , and I will set my eyes on him .
We <unk> to my lord : The boy cannot leave his father : for if he leave him , he will die .
And thou saidst to thy servants : Except your youngest brother come with you , you shall see my face no more .
Therefore when we were gone up to thy servant our father , we told him all that my lord had said .
And our father said : Go again , and buy us a little wheat .
And we said to him : We cannot go : if our youngest brother go down with us , we will set out together : otherwise , without him we dare not see the man ’ s face .
<unk> he answered : You know that my wife bore me two .
One went out , and you said : A beast devoured him ; and <unk> he appeareth not .
If you take this also , and any thing befall him in the way , you will bring down my grey hairs with sorrow unto hell .
Therefore , if I shall go to thy servant , our father , and the boy be wanting , ( whereas his life <unk> upon the life of him , )
And he shall see that he is not with us , he will die , and thy servants shall bring down his grey hairs with sorrow unto hell .
His <unk> hairs .... That is , his person , now far advanced in years . — With sorrow unto hell ....
The Hebrew word for hell is here <unk> , the Greek <unk> : it is not taken for the hell of the <unk> ; but for that place of souls below where the servants of God were kept before the coming of Christ .
Which place , both in the <unk> and in the <unk> , is named hell .
Let me be thy proper servant , who took him into my trust , and promised , saying : If I bring him not again , I will be guilty of sin against my father for ever .
Therefore I , thy servant , will stay instead of the boy in the service of my lord , and let the boy go up with his brethren .
For I cannot return to my father without the boy , lest I be a witness of the calamity that will oppress my father .
Genesis Chapter 45 Joseph maketh himself known to his brethren : and sendeth for his father .
Joseph could no longer refrain himself before many that stood by : <unk> he commanded that all should go out , and no stranger be present at their knowing one another .
And he lifted up his voice with weeping , which the Egyptians , and all the house of Pharao heard .
And he said to his brethren : I am Joseph : Is my father yet living ?
His brethren could not answer him , being struck with exceeding great fear .
And he said <unk> to them : Come nearer to me .
And when they were come near him , he said : I am Joseph , your brother , whom you sold into Egypt .
Be not afraid , and let it not seem to you a hard case that you sold me into these countries : for God sent me before you into Egypt for your <unk> .
For it is two years since the famine began to be upon the land , and five years more remain , wherein there can be neither <unk> nor <unk> .
And God sent me before , that you may be preserved upon the earth , and may have food to live .
Not by your counsel was I sent hither , but by the will of God : who hath made me as it were a father to Pharao , and lord of his whole house , and governor in all the land of Egypt .
Make haste , and go ye up to my father , and say to him : Thus saith thy son Joseph : God hath made me lord of the whole land of Egypt ; come down to me , <unk> not .
And thou shalt dwell in the land of Gessen : and thou shalt be near me , thou and thy sons , and thy sons ’ sons , thy sheep , and thy herds , and all things that thou hast .
And there I will feed thee , ( for there are yet five years of famine remaining ) lest both thou perish , and thy house , and all things that thou hast .
Behold , your eyes , and the eyes of my brother Benjamin , see that it is my mouth that speaketh to you .
You shall tell my father of all my glory , and all things that you have seen in Egypt : make haste and bring him to me .
And falling upon the neck of his brother Benjamin , he <unk> him and wept : and Benjamin in like manner wept also on his neck .
And Joseph kissed all his brethren , and wept upon every one of them : after which they were <unk> to speak to him .
And it was heard , and the fame was spread abroad in the king ’ s court : The brethren of Joseph are come ; and Pharao with all his family was glad .
And he spoke to Joseph that he should give orders to his brethren , saying : <unk> your beasts , and go into the land of Chanaan ,
And bring away from thence your father and kindred , and come to me ; and I will give you all the good things of Egypt , that you may eat the marrow of the land .
Give orders also that they take <unk> out of the land of Egypt , for the <unk> of their children and their wives ; and say : Take up your father , and make haste to come with all speed :
And leave nothing of your household <unk> ; for all the riches of Egypt shall be yours .
And the sons of Israel did as they were bid .
And Joseph gave them <unk> according to Pharao ’ s commandment : and provisions for the way .
He ordered also to be brought out for every one of them two robes : but to Benjamin he gave three hundred pieces of silver , with five robes of the best :
<unk> to his father as much money and raiment ; <unk> besides , ten <unk> , to carry off all the riches of Egypt , and as many <unk> , carrying wheat and bread for the journey .
So he sent away his brethren , and at their departing said to them : Be not angry in the way .
And they went up out of Egypt , and came into the land of Chanaan , to their father Jacob .
And they told him , saying : Joseph , thy son , is living ; and he is ruler in all the land of Egypt .
Which when Jacob heard , he awaked as it were out of a deep sleep , yet did not believe them .
They , on the other side , told the whole order of the thing .
And when he saw the <unk> , and all that he had sent , his spirit <unk> ,
And he said : It is enough for me if Joseph , my son , be yet living : I will go and see him before I die .
Genesis Chapter 46 Israel , <unk> by a vision from God , goeth down into Egypt with all his family .
And Israel taking his journey , with all that he had , came to the well of the oath , and killing victims there to the God of his father Isaac , The well of the oath .... Bersabee .
He heard him , by a vision in the night , calling him , and saying to him : Jacob , Jacob .
And he answered him : Lo , here I am .
God said to him : I am the most mighty God of thy father ; fear not , go down into Egypt , for I will make a great nation of thee there .
I will go down with thee thither , and will bring thee back again from thence : Joseph also shall put his hands upon thy eyes .
And Jacob rose up from the well of the oath : and his sons took him up , with their children and wives in the <unk> , which Pharao had sent to carry the old man ,
And all that he had in the land of Chanaan : and he came into Egypt with all his seed ;
His sons , and grandsons , daughters , and all his offspring together .
And these are the names of the children of Israel , that entered into Egypt , he and his children .
His firstborn Ruben ,
The sons of Ruben : Henoch and <unk> , and Hesron and Charmi .
The sons of Simeon : <unk> and <unk> and <unk> , and <unk> and <unk> , and Saul , the son of a woman of Chanaan .
The sons of Levi : Gerson and Caath , and Merari .
The sons of Juda : Her and <unk> , and <unk> , and Phares and Zara .
And Her and <unk> died in the land of Chanaan .
And sons were born to Phares : Hesron and <unk> .
The sons of Issachar : <unk> and <unk> , and Job and <unk> .
The sons of Zabulon : <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> .
These are the sons of Lia , whom she bore in Mesopotamia of Syria , with <unk> , his daughter .

These are the sons of <unk> , whom Laban gave to Lia , his daughter .
And these she bore to Jacob , sixteen souls .
The sons of Rachel , Jacob ’ s wife : Joseph and Benjamin .
And sons were born to Joseph , in the land of Egypt , whom <unk> , the daughter of <unk> , priest of <unk> , bore him : Manasses and Ephraim .
The sons of Benjamin : <unk> and <unk> , and <unk> and <unk> , and Naaman and <unk> , and <unk> and <unk> , and <unk> and <unk> .
These are the sons of Rachel , whom she bore to Jacob : all the souls , fourteen .
The sons of Dan : <unk> .
The sons of Nephthali : <unk> and <unk> , and <unk> and <unk> .
These are the sons of Bala , whom Laban gave to Rachel , his daughter : and these she bore to Jacob : all the souls , seven .
All the souls that went with Jacob into Egypt , and that came out of his thigh , besides his sons ’ wives , <unk> .
And the sons of Joseph , that were born to him in the land of Egypt , two souls .
All the souls of the house of Jacob , that entered into Egypt , were seventy .
And he sent Juda before him to Joseph , to tell him ; and that he should meet him in Gessen .
And when he was come thither , Joseph made ready his chariot , and went up to meet his father in the same place : and seeing him , he fell upon his neck , and <unk> him , wept .
And the father said to Joseph : Now shall I die with joy , because I have seen thy face , and leave thee alive .
And Joseph said to his brethren , and to all his father ’ s house : I will go up , and will tell Pharao , and will say to him : My brethren , and my father ’ s house , that were in the land of Chanaan , are come to me :
And the men are shepherds , and their <unk> is to feed cattle ; their flocks , and herds , and all they have , they have brought with them .
And when he shall call you , and shall say : What is your <unk> ?
You shall answer : We , thy servants , are shepherds , from our infancy until now , both we and our fathers .
And this you shall say , that you may dwell in the land of Gessen , because the Egyptians have all shepherds in abomination .
Genesis Chapter 47 Jacob and his sons are presented before Pharao : he giveth them the land of Gessen .
The famine <unk> the Egyptians to sell all their possessions to the king .
Then Joseph went in and told Pharao , saying : My father and brethren , their sheep and their herds , and all that they possess , are come out of the land of Chanaan : and behold they stay in the land of Gessen .
<unk> men also , the last of his brethren , he presented before the king : The last ... <unk> .
Some interpret this word of the <unk> , and most rightly : but Joseph seems rather to have chosen out such as had the meanest appearance , that Pharao might not think of <unk> them at court , with danger of their <unk> and religion .
And he asked them : What is your <unk> ?
They answered : We , thy servants , are shepherds , both we and our fathers .
We are come to sojourn in thy land , because there is no grass for the flocks of thy servants , the famine being very grievous in the land of Chanaan : and we pray thee to give orders that we thy servants may be in the land of Gessen .
The king therefore said to Joseph : Thy father and thy brethren are come to thee .
The land of Egypt is before thee : and make them dwell in the best place , and give them the land of Gessen .
And if thou knowest that there are <unk> men among them , make them rulers over my cattle .
After this Joseph brought in his father to the king , and presented him before him : and he blessed him .
And being asked by him : How many are the days of the years of thy life ?
He answered : The days of my <unk> are a hundred and thirty years , few , and evil , and they are not come up to the days of the <unk> of my fathers .
And blessing the king , he went out .
But Joseph gave a possession to his father and his brethren in Egypt , in the best place of the land , in <unk> , as Pharao had commanded .
And he nourished them , and all his father ’ s house , <unk> food to every one .
For in the whole world there was want of bread , and a famine had oppressed the land , more especially of Egypt and Chanaan ;
Out of which he gathered up all the money for the corn which they bought , and brought it in to the king ’ s treasure .
And when the <unk> <unk> money , all Egypt came to Joseph , saying : Give us bread : why should we die in thy presence , having now no money ?
And he answered them : Bring me your cattle , and for them I will give you food , if you have no money .
And when they had brought them , he gave them food in <unk> for their horses , and sheep , and oxen , and asses : and he <unk> them that year for the <unk> of their cattle .
And they came the second year , and said to him : We will not hide from our lord , how that our money is spent , and our cattle also are gone : neither art thou ignorant that we have nothing now left but our bodies and our lands .
Why therefore shall we die before thy eyes ?
we will be thine , both we and our lands : buy us to be the king ’ s servants , and give us seed , lest for want of <unk> the land be turned into a wilderness .
So Joseph bought all the land of Egypt , every man <unk> his possessions , because of the greatness of the famine .
And he brought it into Pharao ’ s hands :
And all its people from one end of the borders of Egypt , even to the other end thereof ,
Except the land of the priests , which had been given them by the king : to whom also a certain <unk> of food was given out of the public stores , and therefore they were not forced to sell their possessions .
Then Joseph said to the people : Behold , as you see , both you and your lands belong to Pharao ; take seed and sow the fields ,
That you may have corn .
The fifth part you shall give to the king ; the other four you shall have for seed , and for food for your families and children .
And they answered : our life is in thy hand ; only let my lord look <unk> upon us , and we will <unk> serve the king .
From that time unto this day , in the whole land of Egypt , the fifth part is paid to the kings , and it is become as a law , except the land of the priests , which was free from this covenant .
So Israel dwelt in Egypt , that is , in the land of Gessen , and possessed it ; and grew , and was multiplied exceedingly .
And he lived in it <unk> years : and all the days of his life came to a hundred and <unk> years .
And when he saw that the day of his death drew nigh , he called his son Joseph , and said to him : If I have found favour in thy sight , put thy hand under my thigh ; and thou shalt shew me this kindness and truth , not to bury me in Egypt .
But I will sleep with my fathers , and thou shalt take me away out of this land , and bury me in the burying place of my <unk> .
And Joseph answered him : I will do what thou hast commanded .
And he said : <unk> then to me .
And as he was <unk> , Israel adored God , turning to the bed ’ s head .
To the bed ’ s head .... St. Paul , Heb .
<unk> , following the Greek translation of the <unk> , <unk> adored the top of his rod .
Where note , that the same word in the Hebrew , according to the different <unk> of it , signifies both a bed and a rod .
And to <unk> both these <unk> , we must understand that Jacob leaning on Joseph ’ s rod adored , turning towards the head of his bed : which <unk> , inasmuch as it was <unk> to God , was an <unk> and <unk> worship : but inasmuch as it was <unk> to the rod of Joseph , as a figure of the sceptre , that is , of the royal dignity of Christ , was only an inferior and <unk> honour .
Genesis Chapter 48 Joseph <unk> his father in his sickness , who <unk> his two sons Manasses and Ephraim , and blesseth them , <unk> the younger before the elder .
After these things , it was told Joseph that his father was sick ; and he set out to go to him , taking his two sons Manasses and Ephraim .
And it was told the old man : Behold thy son Joseph cometh to thee .
And being strengthened , he sat on his bed .
And when Joseph was come in to him , he said : God almighty appeared to me at <unk> , which is in the land of Chanaan , and he blessed me ,
And said : I will cause thee to increase and multiply , and I will make of thee a multitude of people : and I will give this land to thee , and to thy seed after thee for an everlasting possession .
So thy two sons , who were born to thee in the land of Egypt before I came hither to thee , shall be mine : Ephraim and Manasses shall be reputed to me as Ruben and Simeon .
But the rest whom thou shalt have after them , shall be thine , and shall be called by the name of their brethren in their possessions .
For , when I came out of Mesopotamia , Rachel died from me in the land of Chanaan in the very journey , and it was spring time : and I was going to Ephrata , and I buried her near the way of Ephrata , which by another name is called Bethlehem .
Then seeing his sons , he said to him : Who are these ?
He answered : They are my sons , whom God hath given me in this place .
And he said : Bring them to me , that I may bless them .
For Israel ’ s eyes were dim by reason of his great age , and he could not see clearly .
And when they were brought to him , he kissed and <unk> them ,
And said to his son : I am not deprived of seeing thee ; moreover God hath shewn me thy seed .
And when Joseph had taken them from his father ’ s <unk> , he bowed down with his face to the ground .
And he set Ephraim on his right hand , that is , towards the left hand of Israel ; but Manasses on his left hand , to wit , towards his father ’ s right hand , and brought them near to him .
But he , stretching forth his right hand , put it upon the head of Ephraim , the younger brother ; and the left upon the head of Manasses , who was the elder , <unk> his hands .
And Jacob blessed the sons of Joseph , and said : God , in whose sight my fathers Abraham and Isaac walked , God that feedeth me from my youth until this day :
The angel that <unk> me from all evils , bless these <unk> : and let my name be called upon them , and the names of my fathers Abraham and Isaac ; and may they grow into a multitude upon the earth .
And Joseph seeing that his father had put his right hand upon the head of Ephraim , was much displeased : and taking his father ’ s hand , he tried to lift it from Ephraim ’ s head , and to remove it to the head of Manasses .
And he said to his father : It should not be so , my father ; for this is the firstborn , put thy right hand upon his head .
But he <unk> , said : I know , my son , I know : and this also shall become a people , and shall be multiplied ; but his younger brother shall be greater than he ; and his seed shall grow into nations .
And he blessed them at that time , saying : In thee shall Israel be blessed , and it shall be said : God do to thee as to Ephraim , and as to Manasses .
And he set Ephraim before Manasses .
And he said to Joseph , his son : Behold I die , and God will be with you , and will bring you back into the land of your fathers .
I give thee a portion above thy brethren , which I took out of the hand of the Amorrhite with my sword and bow .
Genesis Chapter 49 Jacob ’ s <unk> blessings of his twelve sons : his death .
And Jacob called his sons , and said to them : Gather yourselves together , that I may tell you the things that shall befall you in the last days .
Gather yourselves together , and hear , O ye sons of Jacob , hearken to Israel , your father :
Ruben , my firstborn , thou art my strength , and the beginning of my sorrow ; <unk> in gifts , greater in command .
My strength , etc ....
He calls him his strength , as being born whilst his father was in his full strength and <unk> : he calls him the beginning of his sorrow , because cares and sorrows usually come on with the birth of children .
<unk> in gifts , etc . , because the firstborn had a title to a double portion , and to have the command over his brethren , which Ruben <unk> by his sin ; being poured out as water , that is , <unk> and lost .
Thou art poured out as water , grow thou not ; because thou <unk> up to thy father ’ s bed , and didst defile his <unk> .
<unk> thou not ....
This was not meant by way of a curse or <unk> ; but by way of a prophecy <unk> that the tribe of Ruben should not inherit the <unk> usually <unk> to the first birthright , viz . , the double portion , the being prince or lord over the other brethren , and the priesthood : of which the double portion was given to Joseph , the <unk> office to Juda , and the priesthood to Levi .
Simeon and Levi brethren : vessels of iniquity <unk> war .
Let not my soul go into their counsel , nor my glory be in their assembly : because in their fury they slew a man , and in their <unk> they <unk> a wall .
<unk> a man , ...
viz . , Sichem the son of Hemor , with all his people , Gen. 34 . ; mystically and <unk> it alludes to Christ , whom their posterity , viz . , the priests and the scribes , put to death .
Cursed be their fury , because it was stubborn : and their wrath , because it was cruel : I will divide them in Jacob , and will scatter them in Israel .
Juda , thee shall thy brethren praise : thy hand shall be on the necks of thy enemies ; the sons of thy father shall bow down to thee .
Juda is a lion ’ s <unk> : to the prey , my son , thou art gone up : resting thou hast <unk> as a lion , and as a lioness , who shall <unk> him ?
A lion ’ s <unk> , etc ....
This blessing of Juda foretelleth the strength of his tribe , the <unk> of his inheritance ; and <unk> that the sceptre and <unk> power should not be utterly taken away from his race till about the time of the coming of Christ : as in effect it never was : which is a <unk> against the <unk> Jews , that the <unk> is long since come ; for the sceptre has long since been utterly taken away from Juda .
The sceptre shall not be taken away from Juda , nor a ruler from his thigh , till he come that is to be sent , and he shall be the expectation of nations .
<unk> his <unk> to the vineyard , and his ass , O my son , to the vine .
He shall wash his robe in wine , and his garment in the blood of the grape .
His eyes are more beautiful than wine , and his teeth <unk> than milk .
Zabulon shall dwell on the <unk> , and in the <unk> of ships , <unk> as far as Sidon .
Issachar shall be a strong ass , lying down between the borders .
He saw rest that it was good : and the land that it was excellent : and he bowed his shoulder to carry , and became a servant under tribute .
Dan shall judge his people like another tribe in Israel .
Dan shall judge , etc ....
This was verified in Samson , who was of the tribe of Dan , and began to deliver Israel .
Judges <unk> .
But as this deliverance was but temporal and very <unk> , the holy <unk> ( ver .
18 ) <unk> after another kind of <unk> , saying : I will look for thy salvation , O Lord .
Let Dan be a <unk> in the way , a serpent in the path , that <unk> the horse ’ s <unk> , that his rider may fall backward .
I will look for thy salvation , O Lord .
Gad , being girded , shall fight before him : and he himself shall be girded backward .
Gad being girded , etc ....
It seems to <unk> to the tribe of Gad ; when after they had received for their lot the land of Galaad , they marched in arms before the rest of the Israelites , to the <unk> of the land of Chanaan : from whence they afterwards returned <unk> with spoils .
See Jos .
<unk> and 12 .
Aser , his bread shall be fat , and he shall yield <unk> to kings .
Nephthali , a hart let loose , and giving words of beauty .
Joseph is a growing son , a growing son and comely to behold : the daughters run to and fro upon the wall ; <unk> to and fro , etc .... To behold his beauty ; whilst his <unk> brethren turned their <unk> against him , etc .
But they that held <unk> , provoked him , and <unk> with him , and <unk> him .
His bow rested upon the strong , and the bands of his arms and his hands were loosed , by the hands of the mighty one of Jacob : thence he came forth a <unk> , the stone of Israel .
His bow rested upon the strong , etc .... That is , upon God , who was his strength : who also loosed his bands , and brought him out of prison to be the <unk> , that is , the <unk> and ruler of Egypt , and the stone , that is , the rock and support of Israel .
The God of thy father shall be thy helper , and the Almighty shall bless thee with the blessings of heaven above , with the blessings of the deep that lieth beneath , with the blessings of the breasts and of the womb .
The blessings of thy father are strengthened with the blessings of his fathers : until the desire of the everlasting hills should come : may they be upon the head of Joseph , and upon the crown of the Nazarite among his brethren .
The blessings of thy father , etc .... That is , thy father ’ s blessings are made more <unk> and <unk> in thy regard , by the <unk> strength they receive from his <unk> the blessings of his <unk> Abraham and Isaac .
The desire of the everlasting hills , etc ....
These blessings all looked forward towards Christ , called the desire of the everlasting hills , as being <unk> for , as it were , by the whole creation .
<unk> , the <unk> and prophets are called the everlasting hills , by reason of the <unk> of their wisdom and holiness .
The Nazarite ....
This word signifies one separated ; and <unk> to Joseph , as being separated from , and more <unk> than , his brethren .
As the ancient <unk> were so called from their being set aside for God , and vowed to him .
Benjamin a <unk> <unk> , in the morning shall eat the prey , and in the evening shall divide the spoil .
All these are the twelve tribes of Israel : these things their father spoke to them , and he blessed every one with their proper blessings .
And he charged them , saying : I am now going to be gathered to my people : bury me with my fathers in the double cave , which is in the field of Ephron the Hethite , To be gathered to my people .... That is , I am going to die , and so to follow my <unk> that are gone before me , and to join their company in another world .
Over against Mambre , in the land of Chanaan , which Abraham bought together with the field , of Ephron the Hethite , for a possession to bury in .
There they buried him , and Sara his wife : there was Isaac buried with Rebecca , his wife : there also Lia doth lie buried .
And when he had ended the commandments , wherewith he instructed his sons , he drew up his feet upon the bed , and died : and he was gathered to his people .
Genesis Chapter 50 The mourning for Jacob , and his <unk> .
Joseph ’ s kindness towards his brethren .
His death .
And when Joseph saw this , he fell upon his father ’ s face , weeping and <unk> him .
And he commanded his servants , the <unk> , to <unk> his father .
And while they were <unk> his commands , there passed forty days : for this was the manner with bodies that were <unk> , and Egypt mourned for him seventy days .
And the time of the mourning being expired , Joseph spoke to the family of Pharao : If I have found favour in your sight , speak in the ears of Pharao :
For my father made me swear to him , saying : Behold I die ; thou shalt bury me in my sepulchre which I have digged for myself in the land of Chanaan .
So I will go up and bury my father , and return .
And Pharao said to him : Go up and bury thy father according as he made thee swear .
So he went up , and there went with him all the ancients of Pharao ’ s house , and all the elders of the land of Egypt .
And the house of Joseph with his brethren , except their children , and their flocks and herds , which they left in the land of Gessen .
He had also in his <unk> chariots and horsemen : and it was a great company .
And they came to the <unk> floor of <unk> , which is <unk> beyond the Jordan : where <unk> the <unk> with a great and <unk> lamentation , they spent full seven days .
And when the inhabitants of Chanaan saw this , they said : This is a great mourning to the Egyptians .
And therefore the name of that place was called , The mourning of Egypt .
So the sons of Jacob did as he had commanded them .
And carrying him into the land of Chanaan , they buried him in the double cave , which Abraham had bought together with the field for a possession of a burying place , of Ephron , the Hethite , over against Mambre .
And Joseph returned into Egypt with his brethren , and all that were in his company , after he had buried his father .
Now he being dead , his brethren were afraid , and talked one with another : Lest perhaps he should remember the wrong he suffered , and <unk> us all the evil that we did to him .
And they sent a <unk> to him , saying : Thy father commanded us before he died ,
That we should say thus much to thee from him : I beseech thee to forget the wickedness of thy brethren , and the sin and malice they <unk> against thee : we also pray thee , to forgive the servants of the God of thy father this wickedness .
And when Joseph heard this , he wept .
And his brethren came to him ; and worshipping prostrate on the ground , they said : We are thy servants .
And he answered them : Fear not : can we resist the will of God ?
You thought evil against me : but God turned it into good , that he might exalt me , as at present you see , and might save many people .
Fear not : I will feed you and your children .
And he comforted them , and spoke <unk> and <unk> .
And he dwelt in Egypt with all his father ’ s house ; and lived a hundred and ten years .
And he saw the children of Ephraim to the third generation .
The children also of Machir , the sons of Manasses , were born on Joseph ’ s knees .
After which he told his brethren : God will visit you after my death , and will make you go up out of this land , to the land which he swore to Abraham , Isaac , and Jacob .
And he made them swear to him , saying : God will visit you , carry my bones with you out of this place :
And he died , being a hundred and ten years old .
And being <unk> , he was laid in a <unk> in Egypt .
THE BOOK OF <unk> The Second Book of Moses is called <unk> , from the Greek word <unk> , which signifies going out : because it contains the history of the going out of the children of Israel out of Egypt .
The Hebrews , from the words with which it <unk> , call it <unk> <unk> : These are the names .
It contains <unk> for <unk> years ; that is , from the death of Joseph to the <unk> of the tabernacle .
Exodus Chapter 1 The Israelites are multiplied in Egypt .
They are oppressed by a new king , who commandeth all their male children to be killed .
These are the names of the children of Israel , that went into Egypt with Jacob : they went in every man with his household :
Ruben , Simeon , Levi , Juda ,
Issachar , Zabulon , and Benjamin ,
Dan , and Nephthali , Gad and Aser .
And all the souls that came out of Jacob ’ s thigh , were seventy : but Joseph was in Egypt .
After he was dead , and all his brethren , and all that generation ,
The children of Israel increased , and sprung up into multitudes , and growing exceedingly strong they filled the land .
In the mean time there arose a new king over Egypt , that knew not Joseph :
And he said to his people : Behold the people of the children of Israel are numerous and stronger than we .
Come let us wisely oppress them , lest they multiply : and if any war shall rise against us , join with our enemies , and having overcome us , depart out of the land .
Therefore he set over them masters of the works , to afflict them with burdens : and they built for Pharao cities of tabernacles , <unk> , and <unk> .
Of tabernacles .... Or , of storehouses .
But the more they oppressed them , the more they were multiplied and increased .
And the Egyptians hated the children of Israel , and afflicted them and mocked them :
And they made their life bitter with hard works in clay and brick , and with all manner of service , wherewith they were <unk> in the works of the earth .
And the king of Egypt spoke to the <unk> of the Hebrews : of whom one was called <unk> , the other <unk> ,
<unk> them : When you shall do the office of <unk> to the Hebrew women , and the time of delivery is come : if it be a man child , kill it : if a woman , keep it alive .
But the <unk> feared God , and did not do as the king of Egypt had commanded , but saved the men children .
And the king called for them and said : What is it that you meant to do , that you would save the men children ?
They answered : The Hebrew women are not as the Egyptian women : for they themselves are skilful in the office of a <unk> ; and they are delivered before we come to them .
Therefore God dealt well with the <unk> : and the people multiplied and grew exceedingly strong .
And because the <unk> feared God , he built them houses .
Because the <unk> feared God , etc ....
The <unk> were rewarded , not for their lie , which was a <unk> sin ; but for their fear of God , and their humanity : but this reward was only temporal , in building them houses , that is , in <unk> and <unk> their families .
Pharao therefore charged all his people , saying : Whatsoever shall be born of the male sex , ye shall cast into the river : whatsoever of the female , ye shall save alive .
Exodus Chapter 2 Moses is born and exposed on the bank of the river ; where he is taken up by the daughter of Pharao , and <unk> for her son .
He killeth an Egyptian , and fleeth into Madian ; where he marrieth a wife .
After this there went a man of the house of Levi ; and took a wife of his own kindred .
And she conceived , and bore a son : and seeing him a goodly child , hid him three months .
And when she could hide him no longer , she took a basket made of <unk> , and <unk> it with <unk> and pitch : and put the little <unk> therein , and laid him in the <unk> by the river ’ s <unk> ,
His sister standing afar off , and taking notice what would be done .
And behold the daughter of Pharao came down to wash herself in the river : and her maids walked by the river ’ s <unk> .
And when she saw the basket in the <unk> she sent one of her maids for it : and when it was brought ,
She opened it , and seeing within it an infant crying , having compassion on it , she said : This is one of the <unk> of the Hebrews .
And the child ’ s sister said to her : Shall I go , and call to thee a Hebrew woman , to nurse the <unk> ?
She answered : Go .
The maid went and called her mother .
And Pharao ’ s daughter said to her : Take this child , and nurse him for me : I will give thee thy wages .
The woman took and <unk> the child : and when he was grown up , she delivered him to Pharao ’ s daughter .
And she <unk> him for a son , and called him Moses , saying : Because I took him out of the water .
Moses .... Or Moyses , in the Egyptian tongue , signifies one taken or saved out of the water .
In those days , after Moses was grown up , he went out to his brethren : and saw their affliction , and an Egyptian striking one of the Hebrews , his brethren .
And when he had looked about this way and that way , and saw no one there , he slew the Egyptian and hid him in the sand .
He slew the Egyptian ....
This he did by a particular <unk> of God ; as a <unk> to his delivering the people from their oppression and bondage .
He thought , says St. Stephen , Acts <unk> , that his brethren understood that God by his hand would save them .
But such particular and <unk> <unk> are not to be <unk> .
And going out the next day , he saw two Hebrews <unk> : and he said to him that did the wrong : Why <unk> thou thy neighbour ?
But he answered : Who hath appointed thee prince and judge over us ?
wilt thou kill me , as thou didst yesterday kill the Egyptian ?
Moses feared , and said : How is this come to be known ?
And Pharao heard of this word , and sought to kill Moses : but he fled from his sight , and abode in the land of Madian , and he sat down by a well .
Madian .... A city and country of Arabia , which took its name from Madian the son of Abraham , by <unk> , and was <unk> by his posterity .
And the priest of Madian had seven daughters , who came to draw water : and when the <unk> were filled , desired to water their father ’ s flocks .
And the shepherds came and drove them away : and Moses arose , and <unk> the maids , watered their sheep .
And when they returned to Raguel their father , he said to them : Why are ye come <unk> than usual ?
Raguel ....
He had two names , being also called Jethro , as appears from the first verse of the following chapter .
They answered : A man of Egypt delivered us from the hands of the shepherds : and he drew water also with us , and gave the sheep to drink .
But he said : Where is he ?
why have you let the man go ?
call him that he may eat bread .
And Moses swore that he would dwell with him .
And he took <unk> his daughter to wife :
And she bore him a son , whom he called <unk> , saying : I have been a stranger in a foreign country .
And she bore another , whom he called Eliezer , saying : For the God of my father , my helper , hath delivered me out of the hand of Pharao .
<unk> .... Or <unk> .
This name signifies a stranger there : as Eliezer signifies the help of God .
Now after a long time the king of Egypt died : and the children of Israel groaning , cried out because of the works : and their cry went up unto God from the works .
And he heard their groaning , and remembered the covenant which he made with Abraham , Isaac , and Jacob .
And the Lord looked upon the children of Israel , and he knew them .
<unk> them .... That is , he had respect to them , he cast a merciful eye upon them .
Exodus Chapter 3 God appeareth to Moses in a bush , and sendeth him to deliver Israel .
Now Moses fed the sheep of Jethro , his father in law , the priest of Madian : and he drove the flock to the inner parts of the desert , and came to the mountain of God , Horeb .
And the Lord appeared to him in a flame of fire out of the midst of a bush : and he saw that the bush was on fire , and was not burnt .
The Lord appeared .... That is , an angel <unk> God , and speaking in his name .
And Moses said : I will go , and see this great sight , why the bush is not burnt .
And when the Lord saw that he went forward to see , he called to him out of the midst of the bush .
and said : Moses , Moses .
And he answered : Here I am .
And he said : Come not nigh hither , put off the shoes from thy feet ; for the place , <unk> thou <unk> , is holy ground .
And he said : I am the God of thy father , the God of Abraham , the God of Isaac , and the God of Jacob .
Moses hid his face : for he durst not look at God .
And the Lord said to him : I have seen the affliction of my people in Egypt , and I have heard their cry because of the <unk> of them that are over the works ;
And knowing their sorrow , I am come down to deliver them out of the hands of the Egyptians , and to bring them out of that land into a good and <unk> land , into a land that <unk> with milk and honey , to the places of the Chanaanite , and Hethite , and Amorrhite , and Pherezite , and Hevite , and Jebusite .
For the cry of the children of Israel is come unto me : and I have seen their affliction , wherewith they are oppressed by the Egyptians .
But come , and I will send thee to Pharao , that thou mayst bring forth my people , the children of Israel , out of Egypt .
And Moses said to God : Who am I that I should go to Pharao , and should bring forth the children of Israel out of Egypt ?
And he said to him : I will be with thee ; and this thou shalt have for a sign that I have sent thee : When thou shalt have brought my people out of Egypt , thou shalt offer sacrifice to God upon this mountain .
Moses said to God : Lo , I shall go to the children of Israel , and say to them : The God of your fathers hath sent me to you .
If they shall say to me : What is his name ?
What shall I say to them ?
God said to Moses : I <unk> <unk> <unk> .
He said : Thus shalt thou say to the children of Israel : <unk> <unk> <unk> , hath sent me to you .
I am who am .... That is , I am being itself , eternal , <unk> , <unk> , infinite ; without beginning , end , or change ; and the <unk> of all other <unk> .
And God said again to Moses : Thus shalt thou say to the children of Israel : The Lord God of your fathers the God of Abraham , the God of Isaac , and the God of Jacob hath sent me to you ; this is my name for ever , and this is my memorial unto all generations .
Go and gather together the ancients of Israel , and thou shalt say to them : The Lord God of your fathers , the God of Abraham , the God of Isaac , and the God of Jacob , hath appeared to me , saying : <unk> I have visited you ; and I have seen all that hath befallen you in Egypt .
And I have said the word to bring you forth out of the affliction of Egypt , into the land of the Chanaanite , and Hethite , and Amorrhite , and Pherezite , and Hevite , and Jebusite , to a land that <unk> with milk and honey .
And they shall hear thy voice ; and thou shalt go in , thou and the ancients of Israel , to the king of Egypt , and thou shalt say to him : The Lord God of the Hebrews hath called us ; we will go three days ’ journey into the wilderness , to sacrifice unto the Lord our God .
But I know that the king of Egypt will not let you go , but by a mighty hand .
For I will stretch forth my hand , and will strike Egypt with all my wonders which I will do in the midst of them : after these he will let you go .
And I will give favour to this people , in the sight of the Egyptians : and when you go forth , you shall not depart empty :
But every woman shall ask of her neighbour , and of her that is in her house , vessels of silver and of gold , and raiment : and you shall put them on your sons and daughters , and shall spoil Egypt .
Shall spoil , etc .... That is , you shall strip , and take away the goods of the Egyptians .
This was not <unk> theft or injustice ; but was a just <unk> made by Him , who is the great lord and master of all things , in order to pay the children of Israel some part of what was due to them from the Egyptians for their labours .
Exodus Chapter 4 Moses is <unk> to confirm his mission with miracles : his brother Aaron is appointed to assist him .
Moses answered , and said : They will not believe me , nor hear my voice , but they will say : The Lord hath not appeared to thee .
Then he said to him : What is that thou <unk> in thy hand ?
He answered : A rod .
And the Lord said : Cast it down upon the ground .
He cast it down , and it was turned into a serpent , so that Moses fled from it .
And the Lord said : Put out thy hand , and take it by the tail .
He put forth his hand , and took hold of it , and it was turned into a rod .
That they may believe , saith he , that the Lord God of their fathers , the God of Abraham , the God of Isaac , and the God of Jacob , hath appeared to thee .
And the Lord said again : Put thy hand into thy bosom .
And when he had put it into his bosom , he brought it forth <unk> as snow .
And he said : Put back thy hand into thy bosom .
He put it back , and brought it out again , and it was like the other flesh .
If they will not believe thee , saith he , nor hear the voice of the former sign , they will believe the word of the latter sign .
But if they will not even believe these two signs , nor hear thy voice : take of the river water , and pour it out upon the dry land , and whatsoever thou <unk> out of the river , shall be turned into blood .
Moses said : I beseech thee , Lord , I am not <unk> from yesterday and the day before ; and since thou hast spoken to thy servant , I have more <unk> and <unk> of tongue .
The Lord said to him : Who made man ’ s mouth ?
or who made the dumb and the deaf , the seeing and the blind ?
did not I ?
Go therefore , and I will be in thy mouth ; and I will teach thee what thou shalt speak .
But he said : I beseech thee , Lord , send whom thou wilt send .
The Lord being angry at Moses , said : Aaron the Levite is thy brother , I know that he is <unk> : behold he cometh forth to meet thee , and seeing thee , shall be glad at heart .
Speak to him , and put my words in his mouth : and I will be in thy mouth , and in his mouth , and will shew you what you must do .
He shall speak in thy stead to the people , and shall be thy mouth : but thou shalt be to him in those things that <unk> to God .
And take this rod in thy hand , wherewith thou shalt do the signs .
Moses went his way , and returned to Jethro his father in law , and said to him ; I will go and return to my brethren into Egypt , that I may see if they be yet alive .
And Jethro said to him : Go in peace .
And the Lord said to Moses , in Madian : Go , and return into Egypt ; for they are all dead that sought thy life .
Moses therefore took his wife , and his sons , and set them upon an ass ; and returned into Egypt , carrying the rod of God in his hand .
And the Lord said to him as he was returning into Egypt : See that thou do all the wonders before Pharao , which I have put in thy hand : I shall harden his heart , and he will not let the people go .
I shall harden , etc .... Not by being the <unk> cause of his sin ; but by <unk> from him , for his just punishment , the dew of grace that might have <unk> his heart ; and so suffering him to grow <unk> and <unk> .
And thou shalt say to him : Thus saith the Lord : Israel is my son , my firstborn .
I have said to thee : Let my son go , that he may serve me , and thou wouldst not let him go : behold I will kill thy son , thy firstborn .
And when he was in his journey , in the <unk> , the Lord met him , and would have killed him .
The Lord met him , and would have killed him ....
This was an angel <unk> the Lord , who treated Moses in this manner , for having <unk> the circumcision of his younger son ; which his wife understanding , circumcised her child upon the spot , upon which the angel let Moses go .
<unk> <unk> took a very sharp stone , and circumcised the <unk> of her son , and touched his feet , and said : A bloody spouse art thou to me .
And he let him go after she had said : A bloody spouse art thou to me , because of the circumcision .
And the Lord said to Aaron : Go into the desert to meet Moses .
And he went forth to meet him in the mountain of God , and kissed him .
And Moses told Aaron all the words of the Lord , by which he had sent him , and the signs that he had commanded .
And they came together , and they assembled all the ancients of the children of Israel .
And Aaron spoke all the words which the Lord had said to Moses : and he wrought the signs before the people .
And the people believed .
And they heard that the Lord had visited the children of Israel , and that he had looked upon their affliction : and falling down they adored .
Exodus Chapter 5 Pharao <unk> to let the people go .
They are more oppressed .
After these things , Moses and Aaron went in , and said to Pharao : Thus saith the Lord God of Israel : Let my people go , that they may sacrifice to me in the desert .
But he answered : Who is the Lord , that I should hear his voice , and let Israel go ?
I know not the Lord , neither will I let Israel go .
And they said : The God of the Hebrews hath called us , to go three days ’ journey into the wilderness , and to sacrifice to the Lord our God ; lest a pestilence or the sword fall upon us .
The king of Egypt said to them : Why do you Moses and Aaron draw off the people from their works ?
Get you gone to your burdens .
And Pharao said : The people of the land are numerous ; you see that the multitude is increased ; how much more if you give them rest from their works ?
Therefore he commanded the same day the overseers of the works , and the <unk> of the people , saying :
You shall give straw no more to the people to make brick , as before ; but let them go and gather straw .
And you shall lay upon them the <unk> of <unk> , which they did before ; neither shall you <unk> any thing thereof , for they are idle , and therefore they cry , saying : Let us go and sacrifice to our God .
Let them be oppressed with works , and let them fulfil them ; that they may not regard lying words .
And the overseers of the works , and the <unk> , went out and said to the people : Thus saith Pharao : I allow you no straw ;
Go , and gather it where you can find it ; neither shall any thing of your work be diminished .
And the people was scattered through all the land of Egypt to gather straw .
And the overseers of the works pressed them , saying : <unk> your work every day , as before ye were wont to do , when straw was given you .
And they that were over the works of the children of Israel , were scourged by Pharao ’ s <unk> , saying : Why have you not made up the <unk> of <unk> , both yesterday and to day , as before ?
And the officers of the children of Israel came , and cried out to Pharao , saying : Why <unk> thou so with thy servants ?
<unk> is not given us , and <unk> are required of us as before ; behold we , thy servants , are beaten with <unk> , and thy people is unjustly dealt withal .
And he said : You are idle , and therefore you say : Let us go and sacrifice to the Lord .
Go therefore and work : straw shall not be given you , and you shall deliver the accustomed number of <unk> .
And the officers of the children of Israel saw that they were in evil case , because it was said to them : There shall not a <unk> be diminished of the <unk> for every day .
And they met Moses and Aaron , who stood over against them as they came out from Pharao :
And they said to them : The Lord see and judge , because you have , made our savour to <unk> before Pharao and his servants , and you have given him a sword , to kill us .
And Moses returned to the Lord , and said : Lord , why hast thou afflicted this people ?
wherefore hast thou sent me ?
For since the time that I went in to Pharao to speak in thy name , he hath afflicted thy people : and thou hast not delivered them .
Exodus Chapter 6 God <unk> his promise .
The <unk> of Ruben , Simon and Levi , down to Moses and Aaron .
And the Lord said to Moses : Now thou shalt see what I will do to Pharao : for by a mighty hand shall he let them go , and with a strong hand shall he cast them out of his land .
And the Lord spoke to Moses , saying : I am the Lord
That appeared to Abraham , to Isaac , and to Jacob , by the name of God Almighty : and my name <unk> I did not shew them .
My name <unk> ....
The name , which is in the Hebrew text , is that most proper name of God , which signifieth his eternal , <unk> being , Ex .
<unk> , which the Jews out of reverence never <unk> ; but , instead of it , <unk> it <unk> in the Bible , they read <unk> , which signifies the Lord ; and , therefore , they put the <unk> or <unk> , which belong to the name <unk> , to the four letters of that other <unk> name <unk> , He , <unk> , He .
<unk> some <unk> have framed the name <unk> , unknown to all the ancients , whether Jews or Christians ; for the true <unk> of the name , which is in the Hebrew text , by long <unk> , is now quite lost .
And I made a covenant with them , to give them the land of Chanaan , the land of their <unk> wherein they were strangers .
I have heard the groaning of the children of Israel , wherewith the Egyptians have oppressed them : and I have remembered my covenant .
Therefore say to the children of Israel : I am the Lord who will bring you out from the <unk> of the Egyptians , and will deliver you from bondage : and redeem you with a high arm , and great judgments .
And I will take you to myself for my people , I will be your God : and you shall know that I am the Lord your God , who brought you out from the <unk> of the Egyptians :
And brought you into the land , concerning which I lifted up my hand to give it to Abraham , Isaac , and Jacob : and I will give it you to possess : I am the Lord .
And Moses told all this to the children of Israel : but they did not hearken to him , for anguish of spirit , and most <unk> work .
And the Lord spoke to Moses , saying :
Go in , and speak to Pharao king of Egypt , that he let the children of Israel go out of his land .
Moses answered before the Lord : Behold the children of Israel do not hearken to me : and how will Pharao hear me , especially as I am of uncircumcised lips ?
<unk> lips ....
So he calls the <unk> he had in his words , or <unk> .
And the Lord spoke to Moses and Aaron , and he gave them a charge unto the children of Israel , and unto Pharao the king of Egypt , that they should bring forth the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt .
These are the heads of their houses by their families .
The sons of Ruben the firstborn of Israel : Henoch and <unk> , Hesron and Charmi .
These are the kindreds of Ruben .
The sons of Simeon , <unk> and <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> , and Saul the son of a <unk> : these are the families of Simeon .
And these are the names of the sons of Levi by their kindreds : Gerson , and Caath , and Merari .
And the years of the life of Levi were a hundred and <unk> .
The sons of Gerson : <unk> and Semei , by their kindreds .
The sons of Caath : Amram , and Isaar , and Hebron and Oziel .
And the years of Caath ’ s life , were a hundred and <unk> .
The sons of Merari : Moholi and <unk> .
These are the kindreds of Levi by their families .
And Amram took to wife <unk> his <unk> by the father ’ s side : and she bore him Aaron and Moses .
And the years of Amram ’ s life , were a hundred and <unk> .
The sons also of Isaar : Core , and <unk> , and Zechri .
The sons also of Oziel : <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> .
And Aaron took to wife Elizabeth the daughter of Aminadab , sister of <unk> , who bore him Nadab , and Abiu , and Eleazar , and Ithamar .
The sons also of Core : Aser , and Elcana , and <unk> .
These are the kindreds of the <unk> .
But Eleazar the son of Aaron took a wife of the daughters of <unk> : and she bore him Phinees .
These are the heads of the Levitical families by their kindreds .
These are Aaron and Moses , whom the Lord commanded to bring forth the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt by their companies .
These are they that speak to Pharao , king of Egypt , in order to bring out the children of Israel from Egypt : these are that Moses and Aaron ,
In the day when the Lord spoke to Moses in the land of Egypt .
And the Lord spoke to Moses , saying : I am the Lord ; speak thou to Pharao , king of Egypt , all that I say to thee .
And Moses said before the Lord : Lo I am of uncircumcised lips , how will Pharao hear me ?
Exodus Chapter 7 Moses and Aaron go into Pharao : they turn the rod into a serpent ; and the waters of Egypt into blood , which was the first plague .
The magicians do the like , and Pharao ’ s heart is hardened .
And the Lord said to Moses : Behold , I have appointed thee the god of Pharao ; and Aaron , thy brother , shall be thy prophet .
The god of Pharao ....
Viz . , to be his judge ; and to exercise a divine power , as God ’ s instrument , over him and his people .
Thou shalt speak to him all that I command thee ; and he shall speak to Pharao , that he let the children of Israel go out of his land .
But I shall harden his heart , and shall multiply my signs and wonders in the land of Egypt .
I shall harden , etc .... not by being the <unk> cause of his hardness of heart , but by <unk> it ; and by <unk> grace from him , in punishment of his malice ; which alone was the proper cause of his being hardened .
And he will not hear you : and I will lay my hand upon Egypt , and will bring forth my army and my people , the children of Israel , out of the land of Egypt , by very great judgments .
And the Egyptians shall know that I am the Lord , who have stretched forth my hand upon Egypt , and have brought forth the children of Israel out of the midst of them .
And Moses and Aaron did as the Lord had commanded ; so did they .
And Moses was eighty years old , and Aaron <unk> , when they spoke to Pharao .
And the Lord said to Moses and Aaron :
When Pharao shall say to you , Shew signs ; thou shalt say to Aaron : Take thy rod , and cast it down before Pharao , and it shall be turned into a serpent .
So Moses and Aaron went in unto Pharao , and did as the Lord had commanded .
And Aaron took the rod before Pharao and his servants , and it was turned into a serpent .
And Pharao called the wise men and the magicians ; and they also by Egyptian <unk> and certain secrets , did in like manner .
<unk> .... <unk> , and <unk> , or <unk> , 2 <unk> .
<unk> .
And they every one cast down their rods , and they were turned into serpents : but Aaron ’ s rod devoured their rods .
And Pharao ’ s heart was hardened , and he did not hearken to them , as the Lord had commanded .
And the Lord said to Moses : Pharao ’ s heart is hardened , he will not let the people go .
Go to him in the morning , behold he will go out to the waters : and thou shalt stand to meet him on the bank of the river : and thou shalt take in thy hand the rod that was turned into a serpent .
And thou shalt say to him : The Lord God of the Hebrews sent me to thee , saying : Let my people go to sacrifice to me in the desert : and <unk> thou wouldst not hear .
Thus therefore saith the Lord : In this thou shalt know that I am the Lord : behold I will strike with the rod , that is in my hand , the water of the river , and it shall be turned into blood .
And the fishes that are in the river , shall die , and the waters shall be corrupted , and the Egyptians shall be afflicted when they drink the water of the river .
The Lord also said to Moses : Say to Aaron , Take thy rod ; and stretch forth thy hand upon the waters of Egypt , and upon their rivers , and streams and <unk> , and all the <unk> of waters , that they may be turned into blood : and let blood be in all the land of Egypt , both in vessels of wood and of stone .
And Moses and Aaron did as the Lord had commanded : and lifting up the rod , he struck the water of the river before Pharao and his servants : and it was turned into blood .
And the fishes that were in the river died ; and the river corrupted , and the Egyptians could not drink the water of the river , and there was blood in all the land of Egypt .
And the magicians of the Egyptians with their <unk> did in like manner ; and Pharao ’ s heart was hardened , neither did he hear them , as the Lord had commanded .
And he turned himself away , and went into his house , neither did he set his heart to it this time also .
And all the Egyptians dug round about the river for water to drink ; for they could not drink of the water of the river .
And seven days were fully ended , after that the Lord struck the river .
Exodus Chapter 8 The second plague is of frogs : Pharao promiseth to let the Israelites go , but breaketh his promise .
The third plague is of <unk> .
The fourth is of flies .
Pharao again promiseth to <unk> the people , but doth it not .
And the Lord said to Moses : Go in to Pharao , and thou shalt say to him : Thus saith the Lord : Let my people go to sacrifice to me .
But if thou wilt not let them go , behold I will strike all thy coasts with frogs .
And the river shall bring forth an abundance of frogs ; which shall come up and enter into thy house , and thy <unk> , and upon thy bed , and into the houses of thy servants , and to thy people , and into thy <unk> , and into the remains of thy meats :
And the frogs shall come in to thee , and to thy people , and to all thy servants .
And the Lord said to Moses : Say to Aaron : Stretch forth thy hand upon the streams , and upon the rivers and the <unk> , and bring forth frogs upon the land of Egypt .
And Aaron stretched forth his hand upon the waters of Egypt , and the frogs came up , and covered the land of Egypt .
And the magicians also , by their <unk> , did in like manner , and they brought forth frogs upon the land of Egypt .
But Pharao called Moses and Aaron , and said to them : Pray ye to the Lord to take away the frogs from me and from my people ; and I will let the people go to sacrifice to the Lord .
Pray ye to the Lord , etc .... By this it appears , that though the magicians , by the help of the devil , could bring frogs , yet they could not take them away : God being pleased to <unk> in this the power of Satan .
So we see they could not afterwards <unk> the lesser <unk> ; and in this <unk> of the power of the devil , were forced to <unk> the finger of God .
And Moses said to Pharao : Set me a time when I shall pray for thee , and for thy servants , and for thy people , that the frogs may be driven away from thee and from thy house , and from thy servants , and from thy people ; and may remain only in the river .
And he answered : To morrow .
But he said : I will do according to thy word ; that thou mayest know that there is none like to the Lord our God .
And the frogs shall depart from thee , and from thy house , and from thy servants , and from thy people ; and shall remain only in the river .
And Moses and Aaron went forth from Pharao : and Moses cried to the Lord for the promise , which he had made to Pharao concerning the frogs .
And the Lord did according to the word of Moses : and the frogs died out of the houses , and out of the villages , and out of the fields :
And they gathered them together into immense heaps , and the land was corrupted .
And Pharao seeing that rest was given , hardened his own heart , and did not hear them , as the Lord had commanded .
Pharao hardened his own heart .... By this we see that Pharao was himself the <unk> cause of his heart being hardened , and not God . — See the same repeated in ver .
32 .
Pharao hardened his heart at this time also : likewise chap .
<unk> , 35 , and chap .
<unk> .
And the Lord said to Moses : Say to Aaron : Stretch forth thy rod , and strike the dust of the earth ; and may there be <unk> in all the land of Egypt .
<unk> .... Or <unk> , Hebrew <unk> , small flying <unk> , very troublesome both to men and beast .
And they did so .
And Aaron stretched forth his hand , holding the rod ; and he struck the dust of the earth , and there came <unk> on men and on beasts : all the dust of the earth was turned into <unk> through all the land of Egypt .
And the magicians with their <unk> <unk> in like manner , to bring forth <unk> , and they could not : and there were <unk> as well on men as on beasts .
And the magicians said to Pharao : This is the finger of God .
And Pharao ’ s heart was hardened , and he hearkened not unto them , as the Lord had commanded .
The Lord also said to Moses : Arise early , and stand before Pharao ; for he will go forth to the waters : and thou shalt say to him : Thus saith the Lord : Let my people go to sacrifice to me .
But if thou wilt not let them go , behold I will send in upon thee , and upon thy servants , and upon thy houses , all kind of flies : and the houses of the Egyptians shall be filled with flies of divers kinds , and the whole land wherein they shall be .
And I will make the land of Gessen wherein my people is , wonderful in that day , so that flies shall not be there : and thou shalt know that I am the Lord in the midst of the earth .
And I will put a division between my people and thy people : to morrow shall this sign be .
And the Lord did so .
And there came a very grievous <unk> of flies into the houses of Pharao and of his servants , and into all the land of Egypt : and the land was corrupted by this kind of flies .
And Pharao called Moses and Aaron , and said to them : Go and sacrifice to your God in this land .
And Moses said : It cannot be so : for we shall sacrifice the abominations of the Egyptians to the Lord our God : now if we kill those things which the Egyptians worship , in their presence , they will stone us .
The abominations , etc .... That is , the things they worship for Gods : oxen , rams , etc .
It is the usual <unk> of the scriptures to call all idols and false gods , abominations , to signify how much the people of God ought to <unk> and abhor them .
We will go three days ’ journey into the wilderness ; and we will sacrifice to the Lord our God , as he hath commanded us .
And Pharao said : I will let you go to sacrifice to the Lord your God in the wilderness , but go no farther : pray for me .
And Moses said : I will go out from thee , and will pray to the Lord : and the flies shall depart from Pharao , and from his servants , and from his people to morrow : but do not deceive any more , in not <unk> the people go to sacrifice to the Lord .
So Moses went out from Pharao , and prayed to the Lord .
And he did according to his word : and he took away the flies from Pharao , and from his servants , and from his people : there was not left so much as one .
And Pharao ’ s heart was hardened , so that neither this time would he let the people go .
Exodus Chapter 9 The fifth plague is a <unk> among the cattle .
The sixth , of <unk> in men and beasts .
The seventh , of hail .
Pharao promiseth again to let the people go , and breaketh his word .
And the Lord said to Moses : Go in to Pharao , and speak to him : Thus saith the Lord God of the Hebrews : Let my people go to sacrifice to me .
But if thou refuse , and <unk> them still :
Behold my hand shall be upon thy fields ; and a very grievous <unk> upon thy horses , and asses , and camels , and oxen , and sheep .
And the Lord will make a wonderful difference between the possessions of Israel and the possessions of the Egyptians , that nothing at all shall die of those things that belong to the children of Israel .
And the Lord appointed a time , saying : To morrow will the Lord do this thing in the land .
The Lord therefore did this thing the next day : and all the beasts of the Egyptians died , but of the beasts of the children of Israel there died not one .
All the beasts .... That is , many of all kinds .
And Pharao sent to see ; and there was not any thing dead of that which Israel possessed .
And Pharao ’ s heart was hardened , and he did not let the people go .
And the Lord said to Moses and Aaron : Take to you <unk> of ashes out of the <unk> , and let Moses sprinkle it in the air in the presence of Pharao .
And be there dust upon all the land of Egypt : for there shall be <unk> and swelling <unk> both in men and beasts , in the whole land of Egypt .
And they took ashes out of the <unk> , and stood before Pharao , and Moses sprinkled it in the air ; and there came <unk> with swelling <unk> in men and beasts .
Neither could the magicians stand before Moses , for the <unk> that were upon them , and in all the land of Egypt .
And the Lord hardened Pharao ’ s heart , and he hearkened not unto them , as the Lord had spoken to Moses .
<unk> , etc .... See the <unk> above , chap .
<unk> , chap .
<unk> , and chap .
<unk> .
And the Lord said to Moses : Arise in the morning , and stand before Pharao , and thou shalt say to him : Thus saith the Lord , the God of the Hebrews : Let my people go to sacrifice to me .
For I will at this time send all my plagues upon thy heart , and upon thy servants , and upon thy people ; that thou mayst know that there is none like me in all the earth .
For now I will stretch out my hand to strike thee , and thy people , with pestilence , and thou shalt perish from the earth .
And therefore have I raised thee , that I may shew my power in thee , and my name may be spoken of throughout all the earth .
Dost thou yet hold back my people ; and wilt thou not let them go ?
Behold I will cause it to rain to morrow at this same hour , an exceeding great hail ; such as hath not been in Egypt from the day that it was founded , until this present time .
Send therefore now presently , and gather together thy cattle , and all that thou hast in the field ; for men and beasts , and all things that shall be found abroad , and not gathered together out of the fields which the hail shall fall upon , shall die .
He that feared the word of the Lord among Pharao ’ s servants , made his servants and his cattle flee into houses :
But he that regarded not the word of the Lord , left his servants , and his cattle in the fields .
And the Lord said to Moses : Stretch forth thy hand towards heaven , that there may be hail in the whole land of Egypt upon men , and upon beasts , and upon every herb of the field in the land of Egypt .
And Moses stretched forth his rod towards heaven , and the Lord sent thunder and hail , and lightnings running along the ground : and the Lord rained hail upon the land of Egypt .
And the hail and fire <unk> with it drove on together : and it was of so great <unk> , as never before was seen in the whole land of Egypt since that nation was founded .
And the hail destroyed through all the land of Egypt all things that were in the fields , both man and beast : and the hail smote every herb of the field , and it broke every tree of the country .
Only in the land of Gessen , where the children of Israel were , the hail fell not .
And Pharao sent and called Moses and Aaron , saying to them : I have sinned this time also , the Lord is just : I and my people , are wicked .
Pray ye to the Lord that the <unk> of God and the hail may cease : that I may let you go , and that ye may stay here no longer .
Moses said : As soon as I am gone out of the city , I will stretch forth my hands to the Lord , and the thunders shall cease , and the hail shall be no more : that thou mayst know that the earth is the Lord ’ s :
But I know that neither thou , nor thy servants do yet fear the Lord God .
The flax therefore , and the barley were hurt , because the barley was green , and the flax was now <unk> ;
But the wheat , and other winter corn were not hurt , because they were <unk> .
And when Moses was gone from Pharao out of the city , he stretched forth his hands to the Lord : and the thunders and the hail ceased , neither did there drop any more rain upon the earth .
And Pharao seeing that the rain , and the hail , and the thunders were ceased , increased his sin :
And his heart was hardened , and the heart of his servants , and it was made exceeding hard : neither did he let the children of Israel go , as the Lord had commanded by the hand of Moses .
Exodus Chapter 10 The eighth plague of the locusts .
The ninth , of darkness : Pharao is still hardened .
And the Lord said to Moses : Go in to Pharao ; for I have hardened his heart , and the heart of his servants : that I may work these my signs in him ,
And thou mayst tell in the ears of thy sons , and of thy grandsons , how often I have <unk> the Egyptians , and wrought my signs amongst them : and you may know that I am the Lord .
Therefore Moses and Aaron went in to Pharao , and said to him : Thus saith the Lord God of the Hebrews : How long <unk> thou to <unk> to me ?
let my people go , to sacrifice to me .
But if thou resist , and wilt not let them go , behold I will bring in <unk> the locusts into thy coasts ;
To cover the face of the earth , that nothing thereof may appear , but that which the hail hath left may be eaten : for they shall feed upon all the trees that spring in the fields .
And they shall fill thy houses , and the houses of thy servants , and of all the Egyptians : such a number as thy fathers have not seen , nor thy <unk> , from the time they were first upon the earth , until this present day .
And he turned himself away , and went forth from Pharao .
And Pharao ’ s servants said to him : How long shall we endure this scandal ?
<unk> the men go to sacrifice to the Lord their God .
Dost thou not see that Egypt is <unk> ?
And they called back Moses , and Aaron , to Pharao ; and he said to them : Go , sacrifice to the Lord your God : who are they that shall go ?
Moses said : We will go with our young and old , with our sons and daughters , with our sheep and herds : for it is the solemnity of the Lord our God .
And Pharao answered : So be the Lord with you , as I shall let you and your children go : who can doubt but that you <unk> some great evil ?
It shall not be so , but go ye men only , and sacrifice to the Lord : for this yourselves also desired .
And immediately they were cast out from Pharao ’ s presence .
And the Lord said to Moses : Stretch forth thy hand upon the land of Egypt unto the locust , that it come upon it , and devour every herb that is left after the hail .
And Moses stretched forth his rod upon the land of Egypt : and the Lord brought a burning wind all that day , and night ; and when it was morning , the burning wind raised the locusts .
And they came up over the whole land of Egypt ; and rested in all the coasts of the Egyptians , innumerable , the like as had not been before that time , nor shall be hereafter .
And they covered the whole face of the earth , <unk> all things .
And the grass of the earth was devoured , and what fruits soever were on the trees , which the hail had left ; and there remained not any thing that was green on the trees , or in the herbs of the earth , in all Egypt .
Wherefore Pharao in haste called Moses and Aaron , and said to them : I have sinned against the Lord your God , and against you .
But now forgive me my sin this time also , and pray to the Lord your God , that he take away from me this death .
And Moses going forth from the presence of Pharao , prayed to the Lord :
And he made a very strong wind to blow from the west , and it took the locusts and cast them into the Red Sea : there remained not so much as one in all the coasts of Egypt .
And the Lord hardened Pharao ’ s heart , neither did he let the children of Israel go .
And the Lord said to Moses : Stretch out thy hand towards heaven : and may there be darkness upon the land of Egypt so thick that it may be <unk> .
<unk> upon the land of Egypt , so thick that it may be <unk> .... By means of the <unk> <unk> , which were to cause and <unk> the darkness .
And Moses stretched forth his hand towards heaven : and there came horrible darkness in all the land of Egypt for three days .
No man saw his brother , nor moved himself out of the place where he was : but wheresoever the children of Israel dwelt , there was light .
And Pharao called Moses and Aaron , and said to them : Go , sacrifice to the Lord : let your sheep only , and herds remain , let your children go with you .
Moses said : Thou shalt give us also sacrifices and <unk> , to the Lord our God .
All the flocks shall go with us ; there shall not a hoof remain of them : for they are necessary for the service of the Lord our God : especially as we know not what must be offered , till we come to the very place .
And the Lord hardened Pharao ’ s heart , and he would not let them go .
And Pharao said to Moses : Get thee from me , and beware thou see not my face any more : in what day soever thou shalt come in my sight , thou shalt die .
Moses answered : So shall it be as thou hast spoken , I will not see thy face <unk> .
Exodus Chapter 11 Pharao and his people are threatened with the death of their firstborn .
And the Lord said to Moses : Yet one plague more will I bring upon Pharao and Egypt , and after that he shall let you go , and thrust you out .
Therefore thou shalt tell all the people , that every man ask of his friend , and every woman of her neighbour , vessels of silver and of gold .
And the Lord will give favour to his people in the sight of the Egyptians .
And Moses was a very great man in the land of Egypt , in the sight of Pharao ’ s servants , and of all the people .
And he said : Thus saith the Lord : At midnight I will enter into Egypt :
And every firstborn in the land of the Egyptians shall die , from the firstborn of Pharao who sitteth on his throne , even to the firstborn of the handmaid that is at the <unk> , and all the firstborn of beasts .
And there shall be a great cry in all the land of Egypt , such as neither hath been before , nor shall be hereafter .
But with all the children of Israel there shall not a dog make the least noise , from man even to beast ; that you may know how wonderful a difference the Lord maketh between the Egyptians and Israel .
And all these thy servants shall come down to me , and shall worship me , saying : Go forth thou , and all the people that is under thee : after that we will go out .
And he went out from Pharao exceeding angry .
But the Lord said to Moses : Pharao will not hear you , that many signs may be done in the land of Egypt .
And Moses and Aaron did all the wonders that are written , before Pharao .
And the Lord hardened Pharao ’ s heart , neither did he let the children of Israel go out of his land .
The Lord hardened , etc .... See the <unk> above , chap .

Exodus Chapter 12 The manner of <unk> , and eating the paschal lamb : the firstborn of Egypt are all slain : the Israelites depart .
And the Lord said to Moses and Aaron in the land of Egypt :
This month shall be to you the beginning of months ; it shall be the first in the months of the year .
Speak ye to the whole assembly of the children of Israel , and say to them : On the tenth day of this month let every man take a lamb by their families and houses .
But if the number be less than may <unk> to eat the lamb , he shall take unto him his neighbour that <unk> to his house , according to the number of souls which may be enough to eat the lamb .
And it shall be a lamb without blemish , a male , of one year ; according to which rite also you shall take a kid .
A kid ....
The phase might be performed , either with a lamb or with a kid : and all the same rites and ceremonies were to be used with the one as with the other .
And you shall keep it until the fourteenth day of this month ; and the whole multitude of the children of Israel shall sacrifice it in the evening .
And they shall take of the blood thereof , and put it upon both the side posts , and on the upper door posts of the houses , wherein they shall eat it .
And they shall eat the flesh that night <unk> at the fire , and unleavened bread with wild <unk> .
You shall not eat thereof any thing <unk> , nor boiled in water , but only <unk> at the fire ; you shall eat the head with the feet and entrails thereof .
Neither shall there remain any thing of it until morning .
If there be any thing left , you shall burn it with fire .
And thus you shall eat it : you shall gird your reins , and you shall have shoes on your feet , holding staves in your hands , and you shall eat in haste ; for it is the Phase ( that is the <unk> ) of the Lord .
And I will pass through the land of Egypt that night , and will kill every firstborn in the land of Egypt , both man and beast : and against all the gods of Egypt I will execute judgments ; I am the Lord .
And the blood shall be unto you for a sign in the houses where you shall be ; and I shall see the blood , and shall pass over you ; and the plague shall not be upon you to destroy you , when I shall strike the land of Egypt .
And this day shall be for a memorial to you ; and you shall keep it a feast to the Lord in your generations , with an everlasting observance .
Seven days shall you eat unleavened bread : in the first day there shall be no leaven in your houses ; whosoever shall eat any thing leavened , from the first day until the seventh day , that soul shall perish out of Israel .
The first day shall be holy and solemn , and the seventh day shall be kept with the like solemnity : you shall do no work in them , except those things that belong to eating .
And you shall observe the feast of the unleavened bread : for in this same day I will bring forth your army out of the land of Egypt , and you shall keep this day in your generations by a perpetual observance .
The first month , the fourteenth day of the month , in the evening , you shall eat unleavened bread , until the one and twentieth day of the same month , in the evening .
<unk> bread .... By this it appears , that our Saviour made use of unleavened bread , in the <unk> of the blessed sacrament , which was on the evening of the paschal solemnity , at which time there was no leavened bread to be found in Israel .
Seven days there shall not be found any leaven in your houses : he that shall eat leavened bread , his soul shall perish out of the assembly of Israel , whether he be a stranger or born in the land .
You shall not eat any thing leavened : in all your habitations you shall eat unleavened bread .
And Moses called all the ancients of the children of Israel , and said to them : Go take a lamb by your families , and sacrifice the Phase .
And dip a <unk> of hyssop in the blood that is at the door , and sprinkle the <unk> of the door therewith , and both the door <unk> : let none of you go out of the door of his house till morning .
<unk> , etc ....
This <unk> the doors of the Israelites with the blood of the paschal lamb , in order to their being delivered from the sword of the destroying angel , was a <unk> figure of our redemption by the blood of Christ .
For the Lord will pass through striking the Egyptians : and when he shall see the blood on the <unk> , and on both the posts , he will pass over the door of the house , and not suffer the destroyer to come into your houses and to hurt you .
Thou shalt keep this thing as a law for thee and thy children for ever .
And when you have entered into the land which the Lord will give you , as he hath promised , you shall observe these ceremonies .
And when your children shall say to you : What is the meaning of this service ?
You shall say to them : It is the victim of the passage of the Lord , when he passed over the houses of the children of Israel in Egypt , striking the Egyptians , and saving our houses .
And the people bowing themselves , adored .
And the children of Israel going forth , did as the Lord had commanded Moses and Aaron .
And it came to pass at midnight , the Lord slew every firstborn in the land of Egypt , from the firstborn of Pharao , who sat on his throne , unto the firstborn of the captive woman that was in the prison , and all the firstborn of cattle .
And Pharao arose in the night , and all his servants , and all Egypt : and there arose a great cry in Egypt ; for there was not a house wherein there lay not one dead .
And Pharao calling Moses and Aaron , in the night , said : Arise and go forth from among my people , you and the children of Israel : go , sacrifice to the Lord as you say .
Your sheep and herds take along with you , as you <unk> , and departing bless me .
And the Egyptians pressed the people to go forth out of the land speedily , saying : We shall all die .
The people therefore took <unk> before it was leavened ; and <unk> it in their <unk> , put it on their shoulders .
And the children of Israel did as Moses had commanded : and they asked of the Egyptians vessels of silver and gold , and very much raiment .
And the Lord gave favour to the people in the sight of the Egyptians , so that they lent unto them : and they stripped the Egyptians .
And the children of Israel set forward from <unk> to <unk> , being about six hundred thousand men on foot , beside children .
And a mixed multitude , without number , went up also with them , sheep and herds , and beasts of divers kinds , exceeding many .
And they baked the meal , which a little before they had brought out of Egypt in <unk> : and they made hearth <unk> unleavened : for it could not be leavened , the Egyptians <unk> them to depart , and not suffering them to make any stay ; neither did they think of <unk> any meat .
And the abode of the children of Israel that they made in Egypt , was four hundred and thirty years .
Which being expired , the same day all the army of the Lord went forth out of the land of Egypt .
This is the <unk> night of the Lord , when he brought them forth out of the land of Egypt : this night all the children of Israel must observe in their generations .
And the Lord said to Moses and Aaron : This is the service of the Phase ; no <unk> shall eat of it .
But every bought servant shall be circumcised , and so shall eat .
The stranger and the hireling shall not eat thereof .
In one house shall it be eaten , neither shall you carry forth of the flesh thereof out of the house , neither shall you break a bone thereof .
All the assembly of the children of Israel shall keep it .
And if any stranger be willing to dwell among you , and to keep the Phase of the Lord , all his males shall first be circumcised , and then shall he celebrate it according to the manner : and he shall be as he that is born in the land : but if any man be uncircumcised , he shall not eat thereof .
The same law shall be to him that is born in the land , and to the <unk> that <unk> with you .
And all the children of Israel did as the Lord had commanded Moses and Aaron .
And the same day the Lord brought forth the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt by their companies .
Exodus Chapter 13 The paschal solemnity is to be observed ; and the firstborn are to be consecrated to God .
The people are conducted through the desert by a pillar of fire in the night , and a cloud in the day .
And the Lord spoke to Moses , saying :
<unk> unto me every firstborn that openeth the womb among the children of Israel , as well of men as of beasts : for they are all mine .
<unk> unto me every firstborn .... <unk> in this place means that the firstborn males of the Hebrews should be <unk> to the ministry in the divine worship ; and the firstborn of beasts to be given for a sacrifice .
And Moses said to the people : Remember this day in which you came forth out of Egypt , and out of the house of bondage , for with a strong hand hath the Lord brought you forth out of this place : that you eat no leavened bread .
This day you go forth in the month of new corn .
And when the Lord shall have brought thee into the land of the Chanaanite , and the Hethite , and the Amorrhite , and the Hevite , and the Jebusite , which he swore to thy fathers that he would give thee , a land that <unk> with milk and honey , thou shalt celebrate this manner of sacred rites in this month .
Seven days shalt thou eat unleavened bread : and on the seventh day shall be the solemnity of the Lord .
<unk> bread shall you eat seven days : there shall not be seen any thing leavened with thee , nor in all thy coasts .
And thou shalt tell thy son in that day , saying : This is what the Lord did to me when I came forth out of Egypt .
And it shall be as a sign in thy hand , and as a memorial before thy eyes ; and that the law of the Lord be always in thy mouth , for with a strong hand the Lord hath brought thee out of the land of Egypt .
Thou shalt keep this observance at the set time from days to days .
And when the Lord shall have brought thee into the land of the Chanaanite , as he swore to thee and thy fathers , and shall give it thee :
Thou shalt set apart all that openeth the womb for the Lord , and all that is first brought forth of thy cattle : whatsoever thou shalt have of the male sex , thou shalt consecrate to the Lord .
The firstborn of an ass thou shalt change for a sheep : and if thou do not redeem it , thou shalt kill it .
And every firstborn of men thou shalt redeem with a price .
And when thy son shall ask thee to morrow , saying : What is this ?
thou shalt answer him : With a strong hand did the Lord bring us forth out of the land of Egypt , out of the house of bondage .
For when Pharao was hardened , and would not let us go , the Lord slew every firstborn in the land of Egypt , from the firstborn of man to the firstborn of beasts : therefore I sacrifice to the Lord all that openeth the womb of the male sex , and all the firstborn of my sons I redeem .
And it shall be as a sign in thy hand , and as a thing hung between thy eyes , for a remembrance : because the Lord hath brought us forth out of Egypt by a strong hand .
And when Pharao had sent out the people , the Lord led them not by the way of the land of the Philistines , which is near ; thinking lest perhaps they would repent , if they should see wars arise against them , and would return into Egypt .
But he led them about by the way of the desert , which is by the Red Sea : and the children of Israel went up armed out of the land of Egypt .
And Moses took Joseph ’ s bones with him : because he had <unk> the children of Israel , saying : God shall visit you , carry out my bones from hence with you .
And <unk> from <unk> , they encamped in <unk> , in the <unk> coasts of the wilderness .
And the Lord went before them to shew the way , by day in a pillar of a cloud , and by night in a pillar of fire ; that he might be the guide of their journey at both times .
There never failed the pillar of the cloud by day , nor the pillar of fire by night , before the people .
Exodus Chapter 14 Pharao <unk> the children of Israel .
They murmur against Moses , but are encouraged by him , and pass through the Red Sea .
Pharao and his army following them are <unk> .
And the Lord spoke to Moses , saying :
Speak to the children of Israel : Let them turn and <unk> over against <unk> , which is between <unk> and the sea over against <unk> : you shall <unk> before it upon the sea .
And Pharao will say of the children of Israel : They are straitened in the land , the desert hath shut them in .
And I shall harden his heart and he will pursue you : and I shall be glorified in Pharao , and in all his army : and the Egyptians shall know that I am the Lord .
And they did so .
And it was told the king of the Egyptians that the people was fled : and the heart of Pharao and of his servants was changed with regard to the people , and they said : What meant we to do , that we let Israel go from serving us ?
So he made ready his chariot , and took all his people with him .
And he took six hundred chosen chariots , and all the chariots that were in Egypt : and the captains of the whole army .
And the Lord hardened the heart of Pharao , king of Egypt , and he pursued the children of Israel ; but they were gone forth in a mighty hand .
And when the Egyptians followed the steps of them who were gone before , they found them encamped at the sea side : all Pharao ’ s horse and chariots and the whole army were in <unk> , before <unk> .
And when Pharao drew near , the children of Israel lifting up their eyes , saw the Egyptians behind them : and they feared exceedingly , and cried to the Lord .
And they said to Moses : Perhaps there were no graves in Egypt , therefore thou hast brought us to die in the wilderness : why wouldst thou do this , to lead us out of Egypt ?
Is not this the word that we spoke to thee in Egypt , saying : Depart from us , that we may serve the Egyptians ?
for it was much better to serve them , than to die in the wilderness .
And Moses said to the people : Fear not : stand , and see the great wonders of the Lord , which he will do this day ; for the Egyptians , whom you see now , you shall see no more for ever .
The Lord will fight for you , and you shall hold your peace .
And the Lord said to Moses : Why <unk> thou to me ?
Speak to the children of Israel to go forward .
But lift thou up thy rod , and stretch forth thy hand over the sea , and divide it : that the children of Israel may go through the midst of the sea on dry ground .
And I will harden the heart of the Egyptians to pursue you : and I will be glorified in Pharao , and in all his host , and in his chariots and in his horsemen .
And the Egyptians shall know that I am the Lord , when I shall be glorified in Pharao , and in his chariots , and in his horsemen .
And the angel of God , who went before the camp of Israel , <unk> , went behind them : and together with him the pillar of the cloud , leaving the <unk> ,
<unk> behind , between the Egyptians ’ camp and the camp of Israel : and it was a dark cloud , and <unk> the night , so that they could not come at one another all the night .
A dark cloud , and <unk> the night ....
It was a dark cloud to the Egyptians ; but enlightened the night to the Israelites by giving them a great light .
And when Moses had stretched forth his hand over the sea , the Lord took it away by a strong and burning wind <unk> all the night , and turned it into dry ground : and the water was divided .
And the children of Israel went in through the midst of the sea dried up ; for the water was as a wall on their right hand and on their left .
And the Egyptians pursuing went in after them , and all Pharao ’ s horses , his chariots and horsemen , through the midst of the sea .
And now the morning watch was come , and behold the Lord looking upon the Egyptian army through the pillar of fire and of the cloud , slew their host .
And overthrew the wheels of the chariots , and they were carried into the deep .
And the Egyptians said : Let us flee from Israel ; for the Lord <unk> for them against us .
And the Lord said to Moses : Stretch forth thy hand over the sea , that the waters may come again upon the Egyptians , upon their chariots and horsemen .
And when Moses had stretched forth his hand towards the sea , it returned at the first break of day to the former place : and as the Egyptians were fleeing away , the waters came upon them , and the Lord shut them up in the middle of the waves .
And the waters returned , and covered the chariots and the horsemen of all the army of Pharao , who had come into the sea after them , neither did there so much as one of them remain .
But the children of Israel marched through the midst of the sea upon dry land , and the waters were to them as a wall on the right hand and on the left :
And the Lord delivered Israel in that day out of the hands of the Egyptians .
And they saw the Egyptians dead upon the sea shore , and the mighty hand that the Lord had used against them : and the people feared the Lord , and they believed the Lord , and Moses his servant .
Exodus Chapter 15 The canticle of Moses .
The bitter waters of <unk> are made sweet .
Then Moses and the children of Israel sung this canticle to the Lord , and said : Let us sing to the Lord : for he is <unk> magnified , the horse and the rider he hath thrown into the sea .
The Lord is my strength and my praise , and he is become salvation to me : he is my God , and I will glorify him : the God of my father , and I will exalt him .
The Lord is as a man of war , Almighty is his name .
Pharao ’ s chariots and his army he hath cast into the sea : his chosen captains are <unk> in the Red Sea .
The depths have covered them , they are <unk> to the bottom like a stone .
Thy right hand , O Lord , is magnified in strength : thy right hand , O Lord , hath slain the enemy .
And in the multitude of thy glory thou hast put down thy adversaries : thou hast sent thy wrath , which hath devoured them like stubble .
And with the blast of thy anger the waters were gathered together : the flowing water stood , the depths were gathered together in the midst of the sea .
The enemy said : I will pursue and overtake , I will divide the spoils , my soul shall have its fill : I will draw my sword , my hand shall slay them .
Thy wind <unk> and the sea covered them : they <unk> as lead in the mighty waters .
15 : 11 . Who is like to thee , among the strong , O Lord ?
who is like to thee , glorious in holiness , terrible and <unk> , doing wonders ?
Thou <unk> forth thy hand , and the earth swallowed them .
In thy mercy thou hast been a leader to the people which thou hast redeemed : and in thy strength thou hast carried them to thy holy habitation .
<unk> rose up , and were angry : sorrows took hold on the inhabitants of <unk> .
Then were the princes of Edom troubled , trembling seized on the stout men of Moab : all the inhabitants of Chanaan became <unk> .
Let fear and dread fall upon them , in the greatness of thy arm : let them become <unk> as a stone , until thy people , O Lord , pass by : until this thy people pass by , which thou hast possessed .
Thou shalt bring them in , and plant them in the mountain of thy inheritance , in thy most firm habitation , which thou hast made , O Lord ; thy sanctuary , O Lord , which thy hands have established .
The Lord shall reign for ever and ever .
For Pharao went in on <unk> with his chariots and horsemen into the sea : and the Lord brought back upon them the waters of the sea : but the children of Israel walked on dry ground in the midst thereof .
So Mary the <unk> , the sister of Aaron , took a <unk> in her hand : and all the women went forth after her with timbrels and with <unk> .
And she began the song to them , saying : Let us sing to the Lord , for he is <unk> magnified , the horse and his rider he hath thrown into the sea .
And Moses brought Israel from the Red Sea , and they went forth into the wilderness of Sur : and they marched three days through the wilderness , and found no water .
And they came into <unk> , and they could not drink the waters of <unk> because they were bitter : <unk> he gave a name also agreeable to the place , calling it <unk> , that is , bitterness .
And the people murmured against Moses , saying : What shall we drink ?
But he cried to the Lord , and he shewed him a tree , which when he had cast into the waters , they were turned into sweetness .
There he appointed him ordinances , and judgments , and there he proved him ,
Saying : If thou wilt hear the voice of the Lord thy God , and do what is right before him , and obey his commandments , and keep all his precepts , none of the evils that I laid upon Egypt , will I bring upon thee : for I am the Lord thy <unk> .
And the children of Israel came into <unk> , where there were twelve fountains of water , and seventy palm trees : and they encamped by the waters .
Exodus Chapter 16 The people murmur for want of meat : God giveth them <unk> and manna .
And they set forward from <unk> , and all the multitude of the children of Israel came into the desert of Sin , which is between <unk> and Sinai : the fifteenth day of the second month , after they came out of the land of Egypt .
And all the congregation of the children of Israel murmured against Moses and Aaron in the wilderness .
And the children of Israel said to them : Would to God we had died by the hand of the Lord in the land of Egypt , when we sat over the <unk> , and ate bread to the full : Why have you brought us into this desert , that you might destroy all the multitude with famine ?
And the Lord said to Moses : Behold I will rain bread from heaven for you ; let the people go forth , and gather what is sufficient for every day : that I may prove them whether they will walk in my law , or not .
But the sixth day let them provide for to bring in : and let it be double to that they were wont to gather every day .
And Moses and Aaron said to the children of Israel In the evening you shall know that the Lord hath brought you forth out of the land of Egypt :
And in the morning you shall see the glory of the Lord : for he hath heard your murmuring against the Lord : but as for us , what are we , that you <unk> against us ?
And Moses said : In the evening the Lord will give you flesh to eat , and in the morning bread to the full : for he hath heard your <unk> , with which you have murmured against him , for what are we ?
your murmuring is not against us , but against the Lord .
Moses also said to Aaron : Say to the whole congregation of the children of Israel : Come before the Lord ; for he hath heard your murmuring .
And when Aaron spoke to all the assembly of the children of Israel , they looked towards the wilderness ; and behold the glory of the Lord appeared in a cloud .
And the Lord spoke to Moses , saying :
I have heard the murmuring of the children of Israel , say to them : In the evening you shall eat flesh , and in the morning you shall have your fill of bread ; and you shall know that I am the Lord your God .
So it came to pass in the evening , that <unk> coming up , covered the camp : and in the morning a dew lay round about the camp .
And when it had covered the face of the earth , it appeared in the wilderness small , and as it were beaten with a <unk> , like unto the <unk> frost on the ground .
And when the children of Israel saw it , they said one to another : <unk> !
which signifieth : What is this !
for they knew not what it was .
And Moses said to them : This is the bread which the Lord hath given you to eat .
This is the word that the Lord hath commanded : Let every one gather of it as much as is enough to eat ; a <unk> for every man , according to the number of your souls that dwell in a tent , so shall you take of it .
And the children of Israel did so : and they gathered , one more , another less .
And they measured by the measure of a <unk> : neither had he more that had gathered more ; nor did he find less that had provided less : but every one had gathered , according to what they were able to eat .
And Moses said to them : Let no man leave thereof till the morning .
And they hearkened not to him , but some of them left until the morning , and it began to be full of worms , and it <unk> , and Moses was angry with them .
Now every one of them gathered in the morning , as much as might <unk> to eat : and after the sun grew hot , it melted .
But on the sixth day they gathered twice as much , that is , two <unk> every man : and all the rulers of the multitude came , and told Moses .
And he said to them : This is what the Lord hath spoken : To morrow is the rest of the sabbath sanctified to the Lord .
Whatsoever work is to be done , do it ; and the meats that are to be dressed , dress them ; and whatsoever shall remain , lay it up until the morning .
And they did so as Moses had commanded , and it did not <unk> , neither was there worm found in it .
And Moses said : Eat it to day , because it is the sabbath of the Lord : to day it shall not be found in the field .
Gather it six days ; but on the seventh day is the sabbath of the Lord , therefore it shall not be found .
And the seventh day came ; and some of the people going forth to gather , found none .
And the Lord said to Moses : How long will you refuse to keep my commandments , and my law ?
See that the Lord hath given you the sabbath , and for this reason on the sixth day he giveth you a double provision : let each man stay at home , and let none go forth out of his place the seventh day .
And the people kept the sabbath on the seventh day .
And the house of Israel called the name thereof <unk> : and it was like <unk> seed , white , and the taste thereof like to flour with honey .
And Moses said : This is the word which the Lord hath commanded : <unk> a <unk> of it , and let it be kept unto generations to come hereafter ; that they may know the bread , wherewith I fed you in the wilderness when you were brought forth out of the land of Egypt .
And Moses said to Aaron : Take a vessel , and put manna into it , as much as a <unk> can hold ; and lay it up before the Lord , to keep unto your generations ,
As the Lord commanded Moses .
And Aaron put it in the tabernacle to be kept .
And the children of Israel ate manna forty years , till they came to a <unk> land : with this meat were they fed , until they reached the borders of the land of Chanaan .
Now a <unk> is the tenth part of an ephi .
Exodus Chapter 17 The people murmur again for want of drink ; the Lord giveth them water out of a rock .
Moses lifting up his hand in prayer , Amalec is overcome .
Then all the multitude of the children of Israel setting forward from the desert of Sin , by their <unk> , according to the word of the Lord , encamped in <unk> , where there was no water for the people to drink .
And they <unk> with Moses , and said : Give us water , that we may drink .
And Moses answered them : Why <unk> you with me ?
Wherefore do you tempt the Lord ?
So the people were thirsty there for want of water , and murmured against Moses , saying : Why didst thou make us go forth out of Egypt , to kill us and our children , and our beasts with thirst ?
And Moses cried to the Lord , saying : What shall I do to this people ?
Yet a little more and they will stone me .
And the Lord said to Moses : Go before the people , and take with thee of the ancients of Israel : and take in thy hand the rod wherewith thou didst strike the river , and go .
Behold I will stand there before thee , upon the rock Horeb , and thou shalt strike the rock , and water shall come out of it that the people may drink .
Moses did so before the ancients of Israel :
And he called the name of that place <unk> , because of the <unk> of the children of Israel , and for that they tempted the Lord , saying : Is the Lord amongst us or not ?
And Amalec came , and fought against Israel in <unk> .
And Moses said to Josue : <unk> out men ; and go out and fight against Amalec : tomorrow I will stand on the top of the hill , having the rod of God in my hand .
Josue did as Moses had spoken , and he fought against Amalec ; but Moses , and Aaron , and Hur , went up upon the top of the hill .
And when Moses lifted up his hands , Israel overcame ; but if he let them down a little , Amalec overcame .
And Moses ’ s hands were heavy : so they took a stone , and put under him , and he sat on it : and Aaron and Hur stayed up his hands on both sides .
And it came to pass , that his hands were not weary until <unk> .
And Josue put Amalec and his people to flight , by the edge of the sword .
And the Lord said to Moses : Write this for a memorial in a book , and deliver it to the ears of Josue ; for I will destroy the memory of Amalec from under heaven .
And Moses built an altar ; and called the name thereof , The Lord , my <unk> , saying :
Because the hand of the throne of the Lord , and the war of the Lord shall be against Amalec , from generation to generation .
Exodus Chapter 18 Jethro bringeth to Moses his wife and children .
His counsel .
And when Jethro the priest of Madian , the kinsman of Moses , had heard all the things that God had done to Moses , and to Israel his people , and that the Lord had brought forth Israel out of Egypt :
He took <unk> , the wife of Moses , whom he had sent back :
And her two sons , of whom one was called <unk> : his father saying , I have been a stranger in a foreign country .
And the other Eliezer : For the God of my father , said he , is my helper , and hath delivered me from the sword of Pharao .
And Jethro , the kinsman of Moses , came with his sons , and his wife to Moses into the desert , where he was camped by the mountain of God .
And he sent word to Moses , saying : I Jethro , thy kinsman , come to thee , and thy wife , and thy two sons with her .
And he went out to meet his kinsman , and worshipped and kissed him : and they saluted one another with words of peace .
And when he was come into the tent ,
Moses told his kinsman all that the Lord had done to Pharao , and the Egyptians in favour of Israel : and all the labour which had befallen them in the journey , and that the Lord had delivered them .
And Jethro rejoiced for all the good things that the Lord had done to Israel , because he had delivered them out of the hands of the Egyptians .
And he said : Blessed is the Lord , who hath delivered you out of the hand of Pharao , and out of the hand of Egypt .
Now I know , that the Lord is great above all gods ; because he hath delivered his people out of the hand of the Egyptians , who dealt proudly against them .
So Jethro , the kinsman of Moses , offered holocausts and sacrifices to God : and Aaron and all the ancients of Israel came , to eat bread with him before God .
And the next day Moses sat to judge the people , who stood by Moses from morning until night .
And when his kinsman had seen all things that he did among the people , he said : What is it that thou dost among the people ?
Why sittest thou alone , and all the people wait from morning till night ?
And Moses answered him : The people come to me to seek the judgment of God ?
And when any <unk> falleth out among them , they come to me to judge between them , and to shew the precepts of God , and his laws .
But he said : The thing thou dost is not good .
Thou art spent with foolish labour , both thou , and this people that is with thee ; the business is above thy strength , thou alone canst not bear it .
But hear my words and counsels , and God shall be with thee .
Be thou to the people in those things that <unk> to God , to bring their words to him :
And to shew the people the ceremonies , and the manner of worshipping ; and the way wherein they ought to walk , and the work that they ought to do .
And provide out of all the people able men , such as fear God , in whom there is truth , and that hate <unk> , and appoint of them rulers of thousands , and of hundreds , and of <unk> , and of <unk> , 18 : 22 . Who may judge the people at all times : and when any great matter soever shall fall out , let them <unk> it to thee , and let them judge the lesser matters only : that so it may be <unk> for thee , the burden being <unk> out unto others .
If thou dost this , thou shalt fulfil the commandment of God , and shalt be able to bear his precepts : and all this people shall return to their places with peace .
And when Moses heard this , he did all things that he had <unk> unto him .
And <unk> able men out of all Israel , he appointed them rulers of the people , rulers over thousands , and over hundreds , and over <unk> , and over <unk> .
And they judged the people at all times : and whatsoever was of greater <unk> they <unk> to him , and they judged the easier <unk> only .
And he let his kinsman depart : and he returned and went into his own country .
Exodus Chapter 19 They come to Sinai : the people are commanded to be sanctified .
The Lord , coming in thunder and lightning , speaketh with Moses .
In the third month of the <unk> of Israel out of the land of Egypt , on this day they came into the wilderness of Sinai :
For departing out of <unk> , and coming to the desert of Sinai , they camped in the same place , and there Israel pitched their tents over against the mountain .
And Moses went up to God ; and the Lord called unto him from the mountain , and said : Thus shalt thou say to the house of Jacob , and tell the children of Israel : And Moses went up to God .... Moses went up to mount Sinai , where God spoke to him .
You have seen what I have done to the Egyptians , how I have carried you upon the wings of eagles , and have taken you to myself .
If therefore you will hear my voice , and keep my covenant , you shall be my peculiar possession above all people : for all the earth is mine .
And you shall be to me a priestly kingdom , and a holy nation .
These are the words thou shalt speak to the children of Israel .
Moses came ; and calling together the elders of the people , he declared all the words which the Lord had commanded .
And all the people answered together : All that the Lord hath spoken , we will do .
And when Moses had related the people ’ s words to the Lord ,
The Lord said to him : Lo , now will I come to thee in the darkness of a cloud , that the people may hear me speaking to thee , and may believe thee for ever .
And Moses told the words of the people to the Lord .
And he said to him : Go to the people , and sanctify them to day , and to morrow , and let them wash their garments .
And let them be ready against the third day ; for on the third day the Lord will come down in the sight of all the people , upon Mount Sinai .
And thou shalt appoint certain limits to the people round about , and thou shalt say to them : Take heed ye go not up into the mount , and that ye touch not the borders thereof : every one that toucheth the mount , dying he shall die .
No hands shall touch him , but he shall be stoned to death , or he shall be shot through with arrows : whether it be beast , or man , he shall not live .
When the trumpet shall begin to sound , then let them go up into the mount .
And Moses came down from the mount to the people , and sanctified them .
And when they had washed their garments ,
He said to them : Be ready against the third day , and come not near your wives .
And now the third day was come , and the morning appeared : and behold thunders began to be heard , and lightning to <unk> , and a very thick cloud to cover the mount , and the noise of the trumpet sounded exceeding loud ; and the people that was in the camp , feared .
And when Moses had brought them forth to meet God , from the place of the camp , they stood at the bottom of the mount .
And all Mount Sinai was on a smoke : because the Lord was come down upon it in fire , and the smoke arose from it as out of a furnace : and all the mount was terrible .
And the sound of the trumpet grew by degrees <unk> and <unk> , and was drawn out to a greater length : Moses spoke , and God answered him .
And the Lord came down upon Mount Sinai , in the very top of the mount , and he called Moses unto the top thereof .
And when he was gone up thither ,
He said unto him : Go down , and charge the people ; lest they should have a mind to pass the limits to see the Lord , and a very great multitude of them should perish .
The priests also that come to the Lord , let them be sanctified , lest he strike them .
And Moses said to the Lord : The people cannot come up to Mount Sinai : for thou didst charge , and command , saying : Set limits about the mount , and sanctify it .
And the Lord said to him : Go , get thee down ; and thou shalt come up , thou and Aaron with thee : but let not the priests and the people pass the limits , nor come up to the Lord , lest he kill them .
And Moses went down to the people and told them all .
Exodus Chapter 20 The ten commandments .
And the Lord spoke all these words :
I am the Lord thy God , who brought thee out of the land of Egypt , out of the house of bondage .
Thou shalt not have strange gods before me .
Thou shalt not make to thyself a graven thing , nor the likeness of any thing that is in heaven above , or in the earth beneath , nor of those things that are in the waters under the earth .
A graven thing , nor the likeness of any thing , etc .... All such <unk> , or <unk> , are forbidden by this commandment , as are made to be adored and served ; according to that which immediately follows , thou shalt not adore them , nor serve them .
That is , all such as are designed for idols or <unk> , or are worshipped with divine honour .
But otherwise <unk> , <unk> , or <unk> , even in the house of God , and in the very sanctuary so far from being forbidden , are <unk> <unk> by the word of God .
See Ex .

Thou shalt not adore them , nor serve them : I am the Lord thy God , mighty , jealous , <unk> the iniquity of the fathers upon the children , unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate me :
And shewing mercy unto thousands to them that love me , and keep my commandments .
Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain : for the Lord will not hold him <unk> that shall take the name of the Lord his God in vain .
Remember that thou keep holy the sabbath day .
Six days shalt thou labour , and shalt do all thy works .
But on the seventh day is the sabbath of the Lord thy God : thou shalt do no work on it , thou nor thy son , nor thy daughter , nor thy manservant , nor thy maidservant , nor thy beast , nor the stranger that is within thy gates .
For in six days the Lord made heaven and earth , and the sea , and all things that are in them , and rested on the seventh day : therefore the Lord blessed the seventh day , and sanctified it .
Honour thy father and thy mother , that thou mayst be <unk> upon the land which the Lord thy God will give thee .
Thou shalt not kill .
Thou shalt not commit adultery .
Thou shalt not steal .
Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbour .
Thou shalt not covet thy neighbour ’ s house ; neither shalt thou desire his wife , nor his servant , nor his handmaid , nor his ox , nor his ass , nor any thing that is his .
And all the people saw the voices and the flames , and the sound of the trumpet , and the mount <unk> ; and being terrified and struck with fear , they stood afar off ,
Saying to Moses : Speak thou to us , and we will hear : let not the Lord speak to us , lest we die .
And Moses said to the people : Fear not ; for God is come to prove you , and that the dread of him might be in you , and you should not sin .
And the people stood afar off .
But Moses went to the dark cloud wherein God was .
And the Lord said to Moses : Thus shalt thou say to the children of Israel : You have seen that I have spoken to you from heaven .
You shall not make gods of silver , nor shall you make to yourselves gods of gold .
You shall make an altar of earth unto me , and you shall offer upon it your holocausts and peace offerings , your sheep and oxen , in every place where the memory of my name shall be : I will come to thee , and will bless thee .
And if thou make an altar of stone unto me , thou shalt not build it of <unk> stones ; for if thou lift up a <unk> upon it , it shall be defiled .
Thou shalt not go up by steps unto my altar , lest thy nakedness be discovered .

Exodus Chapter 24 Moses <unk> his law ; and after offering sacrifices , <unk> the blood of the testament upon the people : then goeth up the mountain which God covereth with a fiery cloud .
And he said to Moses : Come up to the Lord , thou , and Aaron , Nadab and Abiu , and seventy of the ancients of Israel , and you shall adore afar off .
And Moses alone shall come up to the Lord , but they shall not come nigh ; neither shall the people come up with him .
So Moses came and told the people all the words of the Lord , and all the judgments : and all the people answered with one voice : We will do all the words of the Lord , which he hath spoken .
And Moses wrote all the words of the Lord : and rising in the morning , he built an altar at the foot of the mount , and twelve <unk> according to the twelve tribes of Israel .
<unk> .... That is , pillars .
And he sent young men of the children of Israel , and they offered holocausts , and sacrificed <unk> victims of calves to the Lord .
<unk> ....
<unk> burnt offerings , in which the whole sacrifice was consumed with fire upon the altar .
Then Moses took half of the blood , and put it into bowls ; and the rest he poured upon the altar .
And taking the book of the covenant , he read it in the hearing of the people : and they said : All things that the Lord hath spoken , we will do , we will be obedient .
And he took the blood and sprinkled it upon the people , and he said : This is the blood of the covenant , which the Lord hath made with you concerning all these words .
Then Moses and Aaron , Nadab and Abiu , and seventy of the ancients of Israel went up :
And they saw the God of Israel : and under his feet as it were a work of sapphire stone , and as the heaven , when clear .
Neither did he lay his hand upon those of the children of Israel , that retired afar off , and they saw God , and they did eat and drink .
And the Lord said to Moses : Come up to me into the mount , and be there ; and I will give thee tables of stone , and the law , and the commandments which I have written ; that thou mayest teach them .
Moses rose up , and his minister Josue : and Moses going up into the mount of God ,
Said to the ancients : <unk> ye here till we return to you .
You have Aaron and Hur with you : if any question shall arise , you shall <unk> it to them .
And when Moses was gone up , a cloud covered the mount .
And the glory of the Lord dwelt upon Sinai , covering it with a cloud six days : and the seventh day he called him out of the midst of the cloud .
And the sight of the glory of the Lord , was like a burning fire upon the top of the mount , in the eyes of the children of Israel .
And Moses entering into the midst of the cloud , went up into the mountain : And he was there forty days and forty nights .
Exodus Chapter 25 <unk> <unk> for making the tabernacle , the ark , the candlestick , etc .
And the Lord spoke to Moses , saying :
Speak to the children of Israel , that they bring firstfruits to me : of every man that offereth of his own accord , you shall take them .
<unk> .... <unk> of some of the best and choicest of their goods .
And these are the things you must take : <unk> , and silver , and brass ,
<unk> and purple , and scarlet twice dyed , and fine linen , and goats ’ hair ,

The wood of a tree that <unk> in the wilderness , which is said to be <unk> .
<unk> to make lights : spices for ointment , and for <unk> incense :
<unk> stones , and precious stones to adorn the ephod and the rational .
The ephod and the rational ....
The ephod was the high priest ’ s upper <unk> ; and the rational his <unk> , in which were twelve <unk> , etc .
And they shall make me a sanctuary , and I will dwell in the midst of them :
According to all the likeness of the tabernacle which I will shew thee , and of all the vessels for the service thereof : and thus you shall make it :
<unk> an ark of setim wood , the length whereof shall be of two cubits and a half ; the breadth , a cubit and a half ; the height , likewise , a cubit and a half .
And thou shalt <unk> it with the purest gold , within and without ; and over it thou shalt make a golden crown round about :
And four golden rings , which thou shalt put at the four corners of the ark : let two rings be on the one side , and two on the other .
Thou shalt make bars also of setim wood , and shalt <unk> them with gold .
And thou shalt put them in through the rings that are in the sides of the ark , that it may be carried on them :
And they shall be always in the rings , neither shall they at any time be drawn out of them .
And thou shalt put in the ark the testimony which I will give thee .
Thou shalt make also a propitiatory of the purest gold : the length thereof shall be two cubits and a half , and the breadth a cubit and a half .
A propitiatory .... a covering for the ark : called a propitiatory , or mercy seat , because the Lord , who was supposed to sit there upon the wings of the cherubims , with the ark for his footstool , from thence shewed mercy .
It is also called the oracle , ver .
18 and 20 ; because from thence God gave his orders and his <unk> .
Thou shalt make also two cherubims of beaten gold , on the two sides of the oracle .
Let one cherub be on the one side , and the other on the other .
Let them cover both sides of the propitiatory , spreading their wings , and covering the oracle , and let them look one towards the other , their faces being turned towards the propitiatory wherewith the ark is to be covered .
In which thou shalt put the testimony that I will give thee .
<unk> will I give orders , and will speak to thee over the propitiatory , and from the midst of the two cherubims , which shall be upon the ark of the testimony , all things which I will command the children of Israel by thee .
Thou shalt make a table also of setim wood , of two cubits in length , and a cubit in breadth , and a cubit and a half in height .
A table .... On which were to be placed the twelve loaves of proposition : or , as they are called in the Hebrew , the face bread , because they were always to stand before the face of the Lord in his temple : as a figure of the <unk> sacrifice and sacrament , in the church of Christ .
And thou shalt <unk> it with the purest gold : and thou shalt make to it a golden <unk> round about .
And to the <unk> itself a <unk> crown , four <unk> high ; and over the same another little golden crown .
Thou shalt prepare also four golden rings , and shalt put them in the four corners of the same table , over each foot .
Under the crown shall the golden rings be , that the bars may be put through them , and the table may be carried .
The bars also themselves thou shalt make of setim wood , and shalt <unk> them with gold , to bear up the table .
Thou shalt prepare also <unk> , and bowls , censers , and cups , wherein the libations are to be offered , of the purest gold .
<unk> .... That is , drink offerings .
And thou shalt set upon the table loaves of proposition in my sight always .
Thou shalt make also a candlestick of beaten work , of the finest gold , the <unk> thereof , and the branches , the cups , and the bowls , and the lilies going forth from it .
A candlestick ....
This candlestick , with its seven lamps , which was always to give light in the house of God , was a figure of the light of the Holy Ghost , and his sevenfold grace , in the sanctuary of the church of Christ .
Six branches shall come out of the sides , three out of one side , and three out of the other .
Three cups as it were <unk> to every branch , and a bowl withal , and a lily : and three cups likewise of the <unk> of <unk> in the other branch , and a bowl withal , and a lily .
Such shall be the work of the six branches , that are to come out from the <unk> :
And in the candlestick itself shall be four cups in the manner of a <unk> , and at every one bowls and lilies .
<unk> under two branches in three places , which together make six , coming forth out of one <unk> .
And both the bowls and the branches shall be of the same beaten work of the purest gold .
Thou shalt make also seven lamps , and shalt set them upon the candlestick , to give light over against .
The <unk> also , and where the <unk> shall be put out , shall be made of the purest gold .
The whole weight of the candlestick , with all the furniture thereof , shall be a talent of the purest gold .
Look , and make it according to the pattern that was shewn thee in the mount .
Exodus Chapter 26 The form of the tabernacle with its <unk> .
And thou shalt make the tabernacle in this manner : Thou shalt make ten curtains of fine twisted linen , and violet and purple , and scarlet twice dyed , <unk> with <unk> .
The length of one curtain shall be twenty-eight cubits ; the breadth shall be four cubits .

And when thou hast taken of the blood that is upon the altar , and of the oil of unction , thou shalt sprinkle Aaron and his vesture , his sons and their vestments .
And after they and their vestments are consecrated ,
Thou shalt take the fat of the ram , and the <unk> , and the fat that covereth the <unk> , and the caul of the liver , and the two kidneys , and the fat that is upon them , and the right shoulder , because it is the ram of consecration :
And one <unk> of bread , a <unk> tempered with oil , a <unk> out of the basket of unleavened bread , which is set in the sight of the Lord :
And thou shalt put all upon the hands of Aaron and of his sons , and shalt sanctify them <unk> before the Lord .

This is what thou shalt sacrifice upon the altar : Two lambs of a year old every day continually ,
One lamb in the morning , and another in the evening .
With one lamb a tenth part of flour tempered with beaten oil , of the fourth part of a hin , and wine for libation of the same measure .
And the other lamb thou shalt offer in the evening , according to the rite of the morning oblation , and according to what we have said , for a savour of sweetness :
It is a sacrifice to the Lord , by perpetual oblation unto your generations , at the door of the tabernacle of the testimony before the Lord , where I will appoint to speak unto thee .
And there will I command the children of Israel , and the altar shall be sanctified by my glory .
I will sanctify also the tabernacle of the testimony with the altar , and Aaron with his sons , to do the office of priesthood unto me .

When thou shalt take the sum of the children of Israel , according to their number , every one of them shall give a price for their souls to the Lord , and there shall be no scourge among them , when they shall be reckoned .
And this shall every one give that passeth at the <unk> , half a sicle according to the standard of the temple .

He that is counted in the number from twenty years and <unk> , shall give the price .
The rich man shall not add to half a sicle , and the poor man shall <unk> nothing .

And the Lord spoke to Moses , saying :
Thou shalt make also a brazen laver with its foot to wash in : and thou shalt set it between the tabernacle of the testimony and the altar .
And water being put into it :
Aaron and his sons shall wash their hands and feet in it :
When they are going into the tabernacle of the testimony , and when they are to come to the altar , to offer on it incense to the Lord ,
Lest perhaps they die .
It shall be an everlasting law to him , and to his seed by <unk> .
And the Lord spoke to Moses ,
Saying : Take spices , of principal and chosen myrrh five hundred sicles , and of <unk> half so much ; that is , two hundred and fifty sicles , of <unk> in like manner two hundred and fifty ,

Exodus Chapter 31 Beseleel and <unk> are appointed by the Lord to make the tabernacle , and the things <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> of the sabbath day is again commanded .
And the Lord <unk> to Moses two tables written with the finger of God .
And the Lord spoke to Moses , saying :
Behold , I have called by name Beseleel the son of <unk> , the son of Hur , of the tribe of Juda ,
And I have filled him with the spirit of God , with wisdom and understanding , and knowledge in all manner of work ,
To devise whatsoever may be <unk> made of gold , and silver , and brass ,
Of <unk> , and precious stones , and variety of wood .
And I have given him for his companion <unk> , the son of <unk> , of the tribe of Dan .
And I have put wisdom in the heart of every skilful man , that they may make all things which I have commanded thee ,
The tabernacle of the covenant , and the ark of the testimony , and the propitiatory , that is over it , and all the vessels of the tabernacle ,
And the table and the vessels thereof , the most pure candlestick with the vessels thereof , and the altars of incense ,
And of holocaust , and all their vessels , the laver with its foot ,
The holy vestments in the ministry for Aaron the priest , and for his sons , that they may execute their office , about the sacred things :
The oil of unction , and the incense of spices in the sanctuary , all things which I have commanded thee , shall they make .
And the Lord spoke to Moses , saying :
Speak to the children of Israel , and thou shalt say to them : See that you keep my sabbath ; because it is a sign between me and you in your generations that you may know that I am the Lord , who sanctify you .
31 : <unk> keep you my sabbath : for it is holy unto you : he that shall profane it , shall be put to death : he that shall do any work in it , his soul shall perish out of the midst of his people .
Six days shall you do work : in the seventh day is the sabbath , the rest holy to the Lord .
Every one that shall do any work on this day , shall die .
Let the children of Israel keep the sabbath , and celebrate it in their generations .
It is an everlasting covenant , and a perpetual sign between me and the children of Israel .
For in six days the Lord made heaven and earth , and in the seventh he ceased from work .
And the Lord , when he had ended these words in Mount Sinai , gave to Moses two stone tables of testimony , written with the finger of God .
Exodus Chapter 32 The people fall into idolatry .
Moses prayeth for them .
He breaketh the tables : destroyeth the idol : <unk> Aaron , and causeth many of the <unk> to be slain .
And the people seeing that Moses <unk> to come down from the mount , gathering together against Aaron , said : Arise , make us gods , that may go before us : For as to this Moses , the man that brought us out of the land of Egypt , we know not what has befallen him .
And Aaron said to them : Take the golden earrings from the ears of your wives , and your sons and daughters , and bring them to me .
And the people did what he had commanded , bringing the earrings to Aaron .
And when he had received them , he fashioned them by <unk> ’ work , and made of them a molten calf .
And they said : These are thy gods , O Israel , that have brought thee out of the land of Egypt .
And when Aaron saw this , he built an altar before it , and made <unk> by a <unk> ’ s voice , saying To morrow is the solemnity of the Lord .
And rising in the morning , they offered holocausts , and peace victims , and the people sat down to eat and drink , and they rose up to play .
And the Lord spoke to Moses , saying : Go , get thee down : thy people , which thou hast brought out of the land of Egypt , hath sinned .
They have quickly <unk> from the way which thou didst shew them : and they have made to themselves a molten calf , and have adored it , and <unk> victims to it , have said : These are thy gods , O Israel , that have brought thee out of the land of Egypt .
And again the Lord said to Moses : I see that this people is <unk> :
Let me alone , that my wrath may be kindled against them , and that I may destroy them , and I will make of thee a great nation .
But Moses besought the Lord his God , saying : Why , O Lord , is thy indignation enkindled against thy people , whom thou hast brought out of the land of Egypt , with great power , and with a mighty hand ?
Let not the Egyptians say , I beseech thee : He <unk> brought them out , that he might kill them in the mountains , and destroy them from the earth : let thy anger cease , and be appeased upon the wickedness of thy people .
Remember Abraham , Isaac , and Israel , thy servants , to whom thou <unk> by thy own self , saying : I will multiply your seed as the stars of heaven : and this whole land that I have spoken of , I will give to your seed , and you shall possess it for ever :
And the Lord was appeased from doing the evil which he had spoken against his people .
And Moses returned from the mount , carrying the two tables of the testimony in his hand , written on both sides ,
And made by the work of God ; the writing also of God was graven in the tables .
And Josue hearing the noise of the people shouting , said to Moses : The noise of battle is heard in the camp .
But he answered : It is not the cry of men <unk> to fight , nor the shout of men <unk> to flee : but I hear the voice of singers .
And when he came nigh to the camp , he saw the calf , and the <unk> : and being very angry , he threw the tables out of his hand , and broke them at the foot of the mount :
And laying hold of the calf which they had made , he burnt it , and beat it to <unk> , which he <unk> into water , and gave thereof to the children of Israel to drink .
And he said to Aaron : What has this people done to thee , that thou shouldst bring upon them a most heinous sin ?
And he answered him : Let not my lord be offended ; for thou knowest this people , that they are <unk> to evil .
They said to me : make us gods , that may go before us ; for as to this Moses , who brought us forth out of the land of Egypt , we know not what is befallen him .
And I said to them : Which of you hath any gold ?
and they took and brought it to me ; and I cast it into the fire , and this calf came out .
And when Moses saw that the people were naked , ( for Aaron had stripped them by occasion of the shame of the filth , and had set them naked among their enemies ) <unk> .... Having lost not only their gold , and their honour , but what was <unk> of all , being stripped also of the grace of God , and having lost him . — The shame of the filth .... That is , of the idol , which they had taken for their god .
It is the usual <unk> of the scripture to call idols filth and abominations .
Then standing in the gate of the camp , he said : If any man be on the Lord ’ s side , let him join with me .
And all the sons of Levi gathered themselves together unto him :
And he said to them : Thus saith the Lord God of Israel : Put every man his sword upon his thigh : go , and return from gate to gate through the midst of the camp , and let every man kill his brother , and friend , and neighbour .
And the sons of Levi did according to the words of Moses , and there were slain that day about three and twenty thousand men .
And Moses said : You have consecrated your hands this day to the Lord , every man in his son and in his brother , that a blessing may be given to you .
And when the next day was come , Moses spoke to the people : You have sinned a very great sin : I will go up to the Lord , if by any means I may be able to entreat him for your crime .
And returning to the Lord , he said : I beseech thee : this people hath sinned a heinous sin , and they have made to themselves gods of gold : either forgive them this trespass ,
Or if thou do not , strike me out of the book that thou hast written .
And the Lord answered him : He that hath sinned against me , him will I strike out of my book :
But go thou , and lead this people whither I have told thee : my angel shall go before thee .
And I in the day of revenge will visit this sin also of theirs .
The Lord therefore struck the people for the <unk> , on occasion of the calf which Aaron had made .
Exodus Chapter 33 The people mourn for their sin .
Moses <unk> the tabernacle without the camp .
He <unk> <unk> with God .
<unk> to see his glory .
And the Lord spoke to Moses , saying : Go , get thee up from this place , thou and thy people which thou hast brought out of the land of Egypt , into the land concerning which I swore to Abraham , Isaac , and Jacob , saying : To thy seed I will give it :
And I will send an angel before thee , that I may cast out the Chanaanite , and the Amorrhite , and the Hethite , and the Pherezite , and the Hevite , and the Jebusite ,
That thou mayst enter into the land that <unk> with milk and honey .
For I will not go up with thee , because thou art a <unk> people ; lest I destroy thee in the way .
And the people hearing these very bad tidings , mourned : and no man put on his ornaments according to custom .
And the Lord said to Moses : Say to the children of Israel : Thou art a <unk> people , once I shall come up in the midst of thee , and shall destroy thee .
Now presently lay aside thy ornaments , that I may know what to do to thee .
So the children of Israel laid aside their ornaments by Mount Horeb .
Moses also taking the tabernacle , pitched it without the camp afar off , and called the name thereof , The tabernacle of the covenant .
And all the people , that had any question , went forth to the tabernacle of the covenant , without the camp .
And when Moses went forth to the tabernacle , all the people rose up , and every one stood in the door of his <unk> , and they beheld the back of Moses , till he went into the tabernacle .
And when he was gone into the tabernacle of the covenant , the pillar of the cloud came down , and stood at the door , and he spoke with Moses .
And all saw that the pillar of the cloud stood at the door of the tabernacle .
And they stood and worshipped at the doors of their tent .
And the Lord spoke to Moses face to face , as a man is wont to speak to his friend .
And when he returned into the camp , his servant Josue , the son of Nun , a young man , departed not from the tabernacle .
<unk> to face .... That is , in a most <unk> manner .
Though as we learn from this very chapter , Moses could not see the face of the Lord .
And Moses said to the Lord : Thou <unk> me to lead forth this people ; and thou dost not let me know whom thou wilt send with me , especially whereas thou hast said : I know thee by name , and thou hast found favour in my sight .
I know thee by name ....
In the language of the scriptures , God is said to know such as he <unk> and <unk> : and to know by name , those whom he favours in a most <unk> manner , as he did his servant Moses .
If therefore I have found favour in thy sight , shew me thy face , that I may know thee , and may find grace before thy eyes : look upon thy people this nation .
And the Lord said : My face shall go before thee , and I will give thee rest .
And Moses said : If thou thyself dost not go before , bring us not out of this place .
For how shall we be able to know , I and thy people , that we have found grace in thy sight , unless thou walk with us , that we may be glorified by all people that dwell upon the earth ?
And the Lord said to Moses : This word also , which thou hast spoken , will I do ; for thou hast found grace before me , and thee I have known by name .
And he said : Shew me thy glory .
He answered : I will shew thee all good , and I will proclaim in the name of the Lord before thee : and I will have mercy on whom I will , and I will be merciful to whom it shall please me .
And again he said : Thou canst not see my face : for man shall not see me , and live .
And again he said : Behold there is a place with me , and thou shalt stand upon the rock .
And when my glory shall pass , I will set thee in a hole of the rock , and protect thee with my right hand till I pass :
And I will take away my hand , and thou shalt see my back parts : but my face thou canst not see .
See my back parts ....
The Lord by his angel , usually spoke to Moses in the pillar of the cloud ; so that he could not see the glory of him that spoke <unk> with him .
In the vision here mentioned he was allowed to see something of him , in an <unk> <unk> form : not in the face , the <unk> of which were too bright for mortal eye to bear , but to view him as it were behind , when his face was turned from him .
Exodus Chapter 34 The tables are renewed : all society with the Chanaanites is forbid : some precepts concerning the firstborn , the sabbath , and other feasts : after forty days ’ fast , Moses returneth to the people with the commandments , and his face appearing <unk> with <unk> of light , he covereth it , <unk> he speaketh to the people .
And after this he said : <unk> thee two tables of stone like unto the former , and I will write upon them the words , which were in the tables , which thou <unk> .
Be ready in the morning , that thou mayst forthwith go up into Mount Sinai , and thou shalt stand with me upon the top of the mount .
Let no man go up with thee , and let not any man be seen throughout all the mount ; neither let the oxen nor the sheep feed over against it .
Then he cut out two tables of stone , such as had been before ; and rising very early he went up into the Mount Sinai , as the Lord had commanded him , carrying with him the tables .
And when the Lord was come down in a cloud , Moses stood with him , calling upon the name of the Lord .
And when he passed before him , he said : O the Lord , the Lord God , merciful and gracious , patient and of much compassion , and true , 34 : 7 . Who <unk> mercy unto thousands : who <unk> away iniquity , and wickedness , and sin , and no man of himself is innocent before thee .
Who <unk> the iniquity of the fathers to the children , and to the <unk> unto the third and fourth generation .
And Moses making haste , bowed down prostrate unto the earth , and adoring ,
Said : If I have found grace in thy sight , O Lord , I beseech thee that thou wilt go with us , ( for it is a <unk> people ) and take away our iniquities and sin , and possess us .
The Lord answered : I will make a covenant in the sight of all , I will do signs such as were never seen upon the earth , nor in any nations ; that this people , in the midst of whom thou art , may see the terrible work of the Lord which I will do .
<unk> all things which this day I command thee : I myself will drive out before thy face the Amorrhite , and the Chanaanite , and the Hethite , and the Pherezite , and the Hevite , and the Jebusite .
Beware thou never join in friendship with the inhabitants of that land , which may be thy ruin :
But destroy their altars , break their statues and cut down their groves :
<unk> not any strange god .
The Lord his name is jealous , he is a jealous God .
Make no covenant with the men of those countries ; lest , when they have committed fornication with their gods , and have adored their idols , some one call thee to eat of the things sacrificed .
Neither shalt thou take of their daughters a wife for thy son , lest after they themselves have committed fornication , they make thy sons also to commit fornication with their gods .
Thou shalt not make to thyself any molten gods .
Thou shalt keep the feast of the unleavened bread .
Seven days shalt thou eat unleavened bread , as I commanded thee in the time of the month of the new corn : for in the month of the spring time thou camest out from Egypt .
All of the male kind that openeth the womb , shall be mine .
Of all beasts ; both of oxen and of sheep , it shall be mine .
The <unk> of an ass thou shalt redeem with a sheep : but if thou wilt not give a price for it , it shall be slain .
The firstborn of thy sons thou shalt redeem : neither shalt thou appear before me empty .
Six days shalt thou work , the seventh day thou shalt cease to plough and to reap .
Thou shalt keep the feast of weeks with the firstfruits of the corn of thy wheat harvest , and the feast when the time of the year returneth that all things are laid in .
Three times in the year all thy males shall appear in the sight of the almighty Lord the God of Israel .
For when I shall have taken away the nations from thy face , and shall have enlarged thy borders , no man shall lie in wait against thy land when thou shalt go up , and appear in the sight of the Lord thy God thrice in a year .
Thou shalt not offer the blood of my sacrifice upon leaven ; neither shall there remain in the morning any thing of the victim of the solemnity of the Phase .
The first of the fruits of thy ground thou shalt offer in the house of the Lord thy God .
Thou shalt not boil a kid in the milk of his <unk> .
And the Lord said to Moses : Write thee these words , by which I have made a covenant both with thee and with Israel .
And he was there with the Lord forty days and forty nights : he neither ate bread nor drank water , and he wrote upon the tables the ten words of the covenant .
And when Moses came down from the Mount Sinai , he held the two tables of the testimony , and he knew not that his face was <unk> from the conversation of the Lord .
<unk> .... That is , shining , and sending forth <unk> of light like horns .
And Aaron and the children of Israel seeing the face of Moses <unk> , were afraid to come near .
And being called by him , they returned , both Aaron and the rulers of the congregation .
And after that he spoke to them ,
And all the children of Israel came to him : and he gave them in commandment all that he had heard of the Lord on Mount Sinai .
And having done speaking , he put a veil upon his face .
But when he went in to the Lord , and spoke with him , he took it away until he came forth , and then he spoke to the children of Israel all things that had been commanded him .
And they saw that the face of Moses when he came out was <unk> , but he covered his face again , if at any time he spoke to them .
Exodus Chapter 35 The sabbath .
<unk> for making the tabernacle .
Beseleel and <unk> are called to the work .
And all the multitude of the children of Israel being gathered together , he said to them : These are the things which the Lord hath commanded to be done :
Six days you shall do work ; the seventh day shall be holy unto you , the sabbath and the rest of the Lord : he that shall do any work on it , shall be put to death .
You shall kindle no fire in any of your habitations on the sabbath day .
And Moses said to all the assembly of the children of Israel : This is the word the Lord hath commanded , saying :
Set aside with you firstfruits to the Lord .
Let every one that is willing and hath a ready heart , offer them to the Lord : gold , and silver , and brass ,
<unk> and purple , and scarlet twice dyed , and fine linen , goats ’ hair ,
And rams ’ skins dyed red , and violet <unk> skins , setim wood ,
And oil to <unk> lights , and to make ointment , and most sweet incense ,
<unk> stones , and precious stones , for the <unk> of the ephod and the rational .
Whosoever of you is wise , let him come , and make that which the Lord hath commanded :
To wit , the tabernacle , and the roof thereof , and the cover , the rings , and the <unk> with the bars , the pillars and the sockets :
The ark and the staves , the propitiatory , and the veil that is drawn before it :
The table with the bars and the vessels , and the loaves of proposition :
The candlestick to bear up the lights , the vessels thereof and the lamps , and the oil for the <unk> of <unk> :
The altar of incense , and the bars , and the oil of unction , and the incense of spices : the hanging at the door of the tabernacle :
The altar of holocaust , and its <unk> of brass , with the bars and vessels thereof : the laver and its foot :
The curtains of the court , with the pillars and the sockets , the hanging in the doors of the entry .
The <unk> of the tabernacle , and of the court , with their little cords :
The vestments that are to be used in the ministry of the sanctuary , the vesture of Aaron the high priest , and of his sons , to do the office of priesthood to me .
And all the multitude of the children of Israel going out from the presence of Moses ,
Offered firstfruits to the Lord with a most ready and devout mind , to make the work of the tabernacle of the testimony .
<unk> was necessary to the service and to the holy vestments ,
Both men and women gave <unk> and earrings , rings and <unk> : every vessel of gold was set aside to be offered to the Lord .
If any man had violet , and purple , and scarlet twice dyed , fine linen and goats ’ hair , <unk> dyed red , and violet <unk> skins ,
<unk> of silver and brass , they offered it to the Lord , and setim wood for divers uses .
The skilful women also gave such things as they had <unk> , violet , purple , and scarlet , and fine linen ,
And goats ’ hair , giving all of their own accord .
But the princes offered onyx stones , and precious stones , for the ephod and the rational ,
And spices and oil for the lights , and for the <unk> of ointment , and to make the incense of most sweet savour .
All , both men and women , with devout mind offered gifts , that the works might be done which the Lord had commanded by the hand of Moses .
All the children of Israel dedicated <unk> offerings to the Lord .
And Moses said to the children of Israel : Behold , the Lord hath called by name Beseleel , the son of <unk> , the son of Hur , of the tribe of Juda ,
And hath filled him with the spirit of God , with wisdom and understanding , and knowledge , and all learning ,
To devise and to work in gold and silver and brass ,
And in <unk> stones , and in <unk> ’ work .
Whatsoever can be devised <unk> ,
He hath given in his heart : <unk> also , the son of <unk> , of the tribe of Dan :
Both of them hath he instructed with wisdom , to do <unk> ’ work , and <unk> , and <unk> in blue and purple , and scarlet twice dyed , and fine linen , and to <unk> all things , and to <unk> all new things .
Exodus Chapter 36 The offerings are delivered to the workmen , the curtains , <unk> , boards , bars , veil , pillars , and hanging are made .
Beseleel therefore , and <unk> , and every wise man , to whom the Lord gave wisdom and understanding , to know how to work <unk> , made the things that are necessary for the uses of the sanctuary , and which the Lord commanded .
And when Moses had called them , and every skilful man , to whom the Lord had given wisdom , and such as of their own accord had offered themselves to the making of the work ,
He delivered all the offerings of the children of Israel unto them .
And while they were earnest about the work , the people daily in the morning offered their vows .
Whereupon the workmen being constrained to come ,
Said to Moses : The people offereth more than is necessary .
Moses therefore commanded <unk> to be made by the <unk> ’ s voice : Let neither man nor woman offer any more for the work of the sanctuary .
And so they ceased from offering gifts ,
Because the things that were offered did <unk> , and were too much .
And all the men that were wise of heart , to accomplish the work of the tabernacle , made ten curtains of twisted fine linen , and violet , and purple , and scarlet twice dyed , with <unk> work , and the art of <unk> :
The length of one curtain was twenty-eight cubits , and the breadth four : all the curtains were of the same <unk> .
And he joined five curtains , one to another , and the other five he <unk> one to another .
He made also <unk> of violet in the edge of one curtain on both sides , and in the edge of the other curtain in like manner ,
That the <unk> might meet one against another , and might be joined each with the other .
Whereupon also he cast fifty rings of gold , that might catch the <unk> of the curtains , and they might be made one tabernacle .
He made also eleven curtains of goats ’ hair , to cover the roof of the tabernacle :
One curtain was thirty cubits long , and four cubits broad : all the curtains were of one measure .
<unk> of which he joined apart , and the other six apart .
And he made fifty <unk> in the edge of one curtain , and fifty in the edge of another curtain , that they might be joined one to another .
And fifty <unk> of brass wherewith the roof might be <unk> together , that of all the curtains there might be made one covering .
He made also a cover for the tabernacle of rams ’ skins dyed red ; and another cover over that of violet skins .
He made also the boards of the tabernacle of setim wood standing .
The length of one board was ten cubits ; and the breadth was one cubit and a half .
There were two <unk> throughout every board , that one might be joined to the other .
And in this manner he made for all the boards of the tabernacle .
Of which twenty were at the south side southward ,
With forty sockets of silver , two sockets were put under one board on the two sides of the corners , where the <unk> of the sides end in the corners .
At that side also of the tabernacle , that looketh towards the north , he made twenty boards ,
With forty sockets of silver , two sockets for every board .
But against the west , to wit , at that side of the tabernacle , which looketh to the sea , he made six boards ,
And two others at each corner of the tabernacle behind :
Which were also joined from beneath unto the top , and went together into one <unk> .
Thus he did on both sides at the corners :
So there were in all eight boards , and they had sixteen sockets of silver , to wit , two sockets under every board .
He made also bars of setim wood , five to hold together the boards of one side of the tabernacle ,
And five others to join together the boards of the other side ; and besides these , five other bars at the west side of the tabernacle towards the sea .
He made also another <unk> , that might come by the midst of the boards from corner to corner .
And the boards themselves he overlaid with gold casting for them sockets of silver .
And their rings he made of gold , through which the bars might be drawn : and he covered the bars themselves with plates of gold .
He made also a veil of violet , and purple , scarlet and fine twisted linen , <unk> and distinguished with <unk> :
And four pillars of setim wood , which with their heads he overlaid with gold , casting for them sockets of silver .
He made also a hanging in the entry of the tabernacle of violet , purple , scarlet , and fine twisted linen , with the work of an <unk> .
And five pillars with their heads , which he covered with gold , and their sockets he cast of brass .
Exodus Chapter 37 Beseleel maketh the ark : the propitiatory , and cherubims , the table , the candlestick , the lamps , and the altar of incense , and <unk> the incense .
And Beseleel made also , the ark of setim wood : it was two cubits and a half in length , and a cubit and a half in breadth , and the height was of one cubit and a half : and he overlaid it with the purest gold within and without .
And he made to it a crown of gold round about ,
<unk> four rings of gold at the four corners thereof : two rings in one side , and two in the other .
And he made bars of setim wood , which he overlaid with gold ,
And he put them into the rings that were at the sides of the ark to carry it .
He made also the propitiatory , that is , the oracle , of the purest gold , two cubits and a half in length , and a cubit and a half in breadth .
Two cherubims also of beaten gold , which he set on the two sides of the propitiatory :
One cherub in the top of one side , and the other cherub in the top of the other side : two cherubims at the two ends of the propitiatory ,
<unk> their wings , and covering the propitiatory , and looking one towards the other , and towards it .
He made also the table of setim wood , in length two cubits , and in breadth one cubit , and in height it was a cubit and a half .
And he overlaid it with the finest gold , and he made to it a golden <unk> round about ,
And to the <unk> itself he made a <unk> crown of gold , of four fingers breadth , and upon the same another golden crown .
And he cast four rings of gold , which he put in the four corners at each foot of the table ,
Over against the crown : and he put the bars into them , that the table might be carried .
The bars also themselves he made of setim wood , and overlaid them with gold .
And the vessels for the divers uses of the table , <unk> , bowls , and cups , and censers of pure gold , wherein the libations are to be offered .
He made also the candlestick of beaten work of the finest gold .
From the <unk> whereof its branches , its cups , and bowls , and lilies came out :
Six on the two sides : three branches on one side , and three on the other .
Three cups in manner of a <unk> on each branch , and bowls withal and lilies : and three cups of the <unk> of a <unk> in another branch , and bowls withal and lilies .
The work of the six branches , that went out from the <unk> of the candlestick was equal .
And in the <unk> itself were four cups after the manner of a <unk> , and bowls withal at every one , and lilies :
And bowls under two branches in three places , which together made six branches going out from one <unk> .
So both the bowls , and the branches were of the same , all beaten work of the purest gold .
He made also the seven lamps with their <unk> , and the vessels where the <unk> were to be put out , of the purest gold .
The candlestick with all the vessels thereof weighed a talent of gold .
He made also the altar of incense of setim wood , being a cubit on every side <unk> , and in height two cubits : from the corners of which went out horns .
And he overlaid it with the purest gold , with its <unk> , and the sides , and the horns .
And he made to it a crown of gold round about , and two golden rings under the crown at each side , that the bars might be put into them , and the altar be carried .
And the bars themselves he made also of setim wood , and overlaid them with plates of gold .
He <unk> also the oil for the ointment of sanctification , and incense of the purest spices , according to the work of a <unk> .
Exodus Chapter 38 He maketh the altar of holocaust .
The brazen laver .
The court with its pillars and hangings .
The sum of what the people offered .
He made also the altar of holocaust of setim wood , five cubits square , and three in height :
The horns whereof went out from the corners , and he overlaid it with plates of brass .
And for the uses thereof , he prepared divers vessels of brass , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> .
And he made the <unk> thereof of brass , in manner of a net , and under it in the midst of the altar a hearth ,
<unk> four rings at the four ends of the net at the top , to put in bars to carry it :
And he made the bars of setim wood , and overlaid them with plates of brass :
And he drew them through the rings that stood out in the sides of the altar .
And the altar itself was not <unk> , but <unk> , of boards , and empty within .
He made also the laver of brass , with the foot thereof , of the <unk> of the women that watched at the door of the tabernacle .
He made also the court , in the south side whereof were hangings of fine twisted linen of a hundred cubits .
<unk> pillars of brass with their sockets , the heads of the pillars , and the whole <unk> of the work , of silver .
In like manner at the north side the hangings , the pillars , and the sockets and heads of the pillars were of the same measure , and work and <unk> .
But on that side that looketh to the west , there were hangings of fifty cubits , ten pillars of brass with their sockets , and the heads of the pillars , and all the <unk> of the work , of silver .
Moreover , towards the east he prepared hangings of fifty cubits :
<unk> cubits of which , were on one side with three pillars , and their sockets :
And on the other side ( for between the two he made the entry of the tabernacle ) there were hangings equally of fifteen cubits , and three pillars , and as many sockets .
All the hangings of the court were woven with twisted linen .
The sockets of the pillars were of brass , and their heads with all their <unk> of silver : and he overlaid the pillars of the court also with silver .
And he made in the entry thereof an embroidered hanging of violet , purple , scarlet , and fine twisted linen , that was twenty cubits long , and five cubits high , according to the measure of all the hangings of the court .
And the pillars in the entry were four , with sockets of brass , and their heads and <unk> of silver .
The <unk> also of the tabernacle and of the court round about he made of brass .
These are the instruments of the tabernacle of the testimony , which were counted according to the commandment of Moses , in the ceremonies of the Levites , by the hand of Ithamar , son of Aaron the priest :
Which Beseleel , the son of <unk> , the son of Hur of the tribe of Juda , had made , as the Lord commanded by Moses .
Having for his companion <unk> , the son of <unk> , of the tribe of Dan : who also was an excellent <unk> in wood , and <unk> in <unk> and <unk> in violet , purple , scarlet , and fine linen .
All the gold that was spent in the work of the sanctuary , and that was offered in gifts , was nine and twenty talents , and seven hundred and thirty sicles according to the standard of the sanctuary .
And it was offered by them that went to be numbered , from twenty years old and <unk> , of six hundred and three thousand five hundred and fifty men able to bear arms .
There were moreover a hundred talents of silver , whereof were cast the sockets of the sanctuary , and of the entry where the veil hangeth .
A hundred sockets were made of a hundred talents , one talent being reckoned for every <unk> .
And of the thousand seven hundred and <unk> he made the heads of the pillars , which also he overlaid with silver .
And there were offered of brass also seventy-two thousand talents , and four hundred sicles besides ,
Of which were cast the sockets in the entry of the tabernacle of the testimony , and the altar of brass with the <unk> thereof , and also the vessels that belong to the use thereof .
And the sockets of the court as well round about as in the entry thereof , and the <unk> of the tabernacle , and of the court round about .
Exodus Chapter 39 All the ornaments of Aaron and his sons are made .
And the whole work of the tabernacle is finished .
And he made , of violet and purple , scarlet and fine linen , the vestments for Aaron to wear when he ministered in the holy places , as the Lord commanded Moses .
So he made an ephod of gold , violet , and purple , and scarlet twice dyed , and fine twisted linen ,
With embroidered work , and he cut <unk> plates of gold , and drew them small into <unk> , that they might be twisted with the <unk> of the <unk> colours ,
And two borders <unk> one to the other in the top on either side ,
And a girdle of the same colours , as the Lord had commanded Moses .
He prepared also two onyx stones , fast set and closed in gold , and graven , by the art of a <unk> , with the names of the children of Israel :
And he set them in the sides of the ephod , for a memorial of the children of Israel , as the Lord had commanded Moses .
He made also a rational with embroidered work , according to the work of the ephod , of gold , violet , purple , and scarlet twice dyed , and fine twisted linen :
<unk> , double , of the measure of a <unk> .
And he set four rows of precious stones in it .
In the first <unk> was a <unk> , a <unk> , an <unk> .
In the second , a <unk> , a sapphire , and a <unk> .
In the third , a <unk> , an <unk> , and an <unk> .
In the fourth , a <unk> , an onyx , and a <unk> , set and enclosed in gold by their rows .
And the twelve stones , were <unk> with the names of the twelve tribes of Israel , each one with its several name .
They made also in the rational little chains , <unk> one to another , of the purest gold ,
And two <unk> , and as many rings of gold .
And they set the rings on either side of the rational ,
On which rings the two golden chains should hang , which they put into the <unk> that stood out in the corners of the ephod .
These both before and behind so answered one another , that the ephod and the rational were bound together ,
Being fastened to the girdle , and strongly <unk> with rings , which a violet <unk> joined , lest they should <unk> loose , and be moved one from the other , as the Lord commanded Moses .
They made also the <unk> of the ephod all of violet ,
And a hole for the head in the upper part at the middle , and a woven border round about the hole :
And beneath at the feet pomegranates of violet , purple , scarlet , and fine twisted linen :
And little <unk> of the purest gold , which they put between the pomegranates at the bottom of the <unk> round about :
To wit , a <unk> of gold , and a <unk> , wherewith the high priest went adorned , when he <unk> his ministry , as the Lord had commanded Moses .
They made also fine linen <unk> with woven work for Aaron and his sons :
And <unk> with their little crowns of fine linen :
And linen <unk> of fine linen :
And a girdle of fine twisted linen , violet , purple , and scarlet twice dyed , of <unk> work , as the Lord had commanded Moses .
They made also the <unk> of sacred <unk> of the purest gold , and they wrote on it with the <unk> of a <unk> : The Holy of the Lord :
And they fastened it to the mitre with a violet <unk> , as the Lord had commanded Moses .
So all the work of the tabernacle and of the roof of the testimony was finished : and the children of Israel did all things which the Lord had commanded Moses .
And they offered the tabernacle , and the roof , and the whole furniture , the rings , the boards , the bars , the pillars and their sockets ,
The cover of rams ’ skins dyed red , and the other cover of violet skins ,
The veil , the ark , the bars , the propitiatory ,
The table , with the vessels thereof , and the loaves of proposition :
The candlestick , the lamps , and the furniture of them , with the oil :
The altar of gold , and the ointment , and the incense of spices :
And the hanging in the entry of the tabernacle :
The altar of brass , the <unk> , the bars , and all the vessels thereof : the laver , with the foot thereof : the hangings of the court , and the pillars , with their sockets :
The hanging in the entry of the court , and the little cords , and the <unk> thereof .
<unk> was wanting of the vessels , that were commanded to be made for the ministry of the tabernacle , and for the roof of the covenant .
The vestments also , which the priests , to wit , Aaron and his sons , use in the sanctuary ,
The children of Israel offered , as the Lord had commanded .
And when Moses saw all things finished , he blessed them .
Exodus Chapter 40 The tabernacle is commanded to be set up and anointed .
God <unk> it with his majesty .
And the Lord spoke to Moses , saying :
The first month , the first day of the month , thou shalt set up the tabernacle of the testimony ,
And shalt put the ark in it , and shalt let down the veil before it :
And thou shalt bring in the table , and set upon it the things that are commanded according to the rite .
The candlestick shall stand with its lamps ,
And the altar of gold , <unk> the incense is burnt before the ark of the testimony .
Thou shalt put the hanging in the entry of the tabernacle ,
And before it the altar of holocaust .
The laver between the altar and the tabernacle , and thou shalt fill it with water .
And thou shalt <unk> the court with hangings , and the entry thereof .
And thou shalt take the oil of unction and anoint the tabernacle with its vessels , that they may be sanctified :
The altar of holocaust and all its vessels :
The laver with its foot : thou shalt consecrate all with the oil of unction , that they may be most holy .
And thou shalt bring Aaron and his sons to the door of the tabernacle of the testimony , and having washed them with water ,
Thou shalt put on them the holy vestments , that they may minister to me , and that the unction of them may prosper to an everlasting priesthood .
And Moses did all that the Lord had commanded .
So in the first month of the second year , the first day of the month , the tabernacle was set up .
And Moses <unk> it up , and placed the boards and the sockets and the bars , and set up the pillars ,
And spread the roof over the tabernacle , putting over it a cover , as the Lord had commanded .
And he put the testimony in the ark , <unk> bars <unk> , and the oracle above .
And when he had brought the ark into the tabernacle , he drew the veil before it to fulfil the commandment of the Lord .
And he set the table in the tabernacle of the testimony , at the north side , without the veil ,
<unk> there in order the loaves of proposition , as the Lord had commanded Moses .
He set the candlestick also in the tabernacle of the testimony , over against the table on the south side ,
<unk> the lamps in order , according to the precept of the Lord .
He set also the altar of gold under the roof of the testimony , over against the veil ,
And burnt upon it the incense of spices , as the Lord had commanded Moses .
And he put also the hanging in the entry of the tabernacle of the testimony ,
And the altar of holocaust in the entry of the testimony , offering the holocaust , and the sacrifices upon it , as the Lord had commanded .
And he set the laver between the tabernacle of the testimony and the altar , <unk> it with water .
And Moses and Aaron , and his sons , washed their hands and feet ,
When they went into the tabernacle of the covenant , and went to the altar , as the Lord had commanded Moses .
He set up also the court round about the tabernacle and the altar , drawing the hanging in the entry thereof .
After all things were perfected ,
The cloud covered the tabernacle of the testimony , and the glory of the Lord filled it .
Neither could Moses go into the tabernacle of the covenant , the cloud covering all things , and the majesty of the Lord shining , for the cloud had covered all .
If at any time the cloud removed from the tabernacle , the children of Israel went forward by their troops :
If it hung over , they remained in the same place .
For the cloud of the Lord hung over the tabernacle by day , and a fire by night , in the sight of all the children of Israel throughout all their <unk> .
THE BOOK OF <unk> This Book is called <unk> , because it <unk> of the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> of the <unk> and Levites .
The Hebrews call it <unk> , from the word with which it <unk> .
Leviticus Chapter 1 Of holocausts or burnt offerings .
And the Lord called Moses , and spoke to him from the tabernacle of the testimony , saying :
Speak to the children of Israel , and thou shalt say to them : The man among you that shall offer to the Lord a sacrifice of the cattle , that is , offering victims of oxen and sheep :
If his offering be a holocaust , and of the herd , he shall offer a male without blemish , at the door of the testimony , to make the Lord <unk> to him .
A holocaust .... That is , a whole burnt offering ( <unk> ) , so called , because the whole victim was consumed with fire ; and given in such manner to God as wholly to <unk> , as it were , for his honour and glory ; without having any part of it reserved for the use of man .
The other sacrifices in the Old Testament were either offerings for sin , or peace offerings : and these latter again were either offered in thanksgiving for blessings received ; or by way of prayer for new favours or graces .
So that sacrifices were then offered to God for four different ends or <unk> , <unk> to the different <unk> which man has to God : 1 .
By way of <unk> , <unk> , praise , and glory due to his divine majesty .
2 .
By way of thanksgiving for all benefits received from him .
3 .
By way of <unk> and <unk> pardon for sins .
4 .
By way of prayer and petition for grace and <unk> in all necessities .
In the New <unk> we have but one sacrifice , viz . , that of the body and blood of Christ : but this one sacrifice of the New Testament perfectly <unk> all these four ends ; and both priest and people , as often as it is celebrated , ought to join in offering it up for these four ends .
And he shall put his hand upon the head of the victim : and it shall be acceptable , and help to its expiation .
And he shall immolate the calf before the Lord : and the priests the sons of Aaron shall offer the blood thereof , pouring it round about the altar , which is before the door of the tabernacle .
And when they have <unk> the victim , they shall cut the joints into pieces :
And shall put fire on the altar , having before laid in order a <unk> of wood .
And they shall lay the parts that are cut out in order <unk> : to wit , the head , and all things that cleave to the liver ;
The entrails and feet being washed with water .
And the priest shall burn them upon the altar for a holocaust , and a sweet savour to the Lord .
And if the offering be of the flocks , a holocaust of sheep or of goats , he shall offer a male without blemish .
And he shall immolate it at the side of the altar that looketh to the north , before the Lord : but the sons of Aaron shall pour the blood thereof upon the altar round about .
And they shall divide the joints , the head , and all that cleave to the liver : and shall lay them upon the wood , under which the fire is to be put .
But the entrails and the feet they shall wash with water .
And the priest shall offer it all and burn it all upon the altar for a holocaust , and most sweet savour to the Lord .
But if the oblation of a holocaust to the Lord be of birds , of <unk> , or of young pigeons :
The priest shall offer it at the altar : and <unk> back the neck , and breaking the place of the wound , he shall make the blood run down upon the brim of the altar .
But the <unk> of the throat , and the <unk> he shall cast beside the altar at the east side , in the place where the ashes are wont to be poured out .
And he shall break the <unk> thereof , and shall not cut , nor divide it with a <unk> : and shall burn it upon the altar , putting fire under the wood .
It is a holocaust and oblation of most sweet savour to the Lord .
Leviticus Chapter 2 Of offerings of flour , and firstfruits .
When any one shall offer an oblation of sacrifice to the Lord , his offering shall be of fine flour : and he shall pour oil upon it , and put frankincense ,
And shall bring it to the sons of Aaron the priests .
And one of them shall take a <unk> of the flour and oil , and all the frankincense ; and shall put it a memorial upon the altar for a most sweet savour to the Lord .
And the remnant of the sacrifice shall be Aaron ’ s , and his sons ’ , holy of holies of the offerings of the Lord .
Holy of holies .... That is , most holy , as being dedicated to God , and set aside by his ordinance for the use of his priests .
But when thou <unk> a sacrifice baked in the oven of flour , to wit , loaves without leaven , tempered with oil , and unleavened <unk> , anointed with oil :
If thy oblation be from the <unk> , of flour tempered with oil , and without leaven :
Thou shalt divide it into little pieces , and shalt pour oil upon it .
And if the sacrifice be from the <unk> , in like manner the flour shall be tempered with oil .
And when thou <unk> it to the Lord , thou shalt deliver it to the hands of the priest .
And when he hath offered it , he shall take a memorial out of the sacrifice , and burn it upon the altar for a sweet savour to the Lord .
And whatsoever is left , shall be Aaron ’ s , and his sons ’ : holy of holies of the offerings of the Lord .
Every oblation that is offered to the Lord shall be made without leaven : neither shall any leaven or honey be burnt in the sacrifice to the Lord .
Without leaven or honey .... No leaven nor honey was to be used in the sacrifice offered to God ; to signify that we are to <unk> from the pure worship of the gospel , all double <unk> and affection to carnal pleasures .
You shall offer only the firstfruits of them and gifts : but they shall not be put upon the altar , for a savour of sweetness .
Whatsoever sacrifice thou <unk> , thou shalt season it with salt : neither shalt thou take away the salt of the covenant of thy God from thy sacrifice .
In all thy oblations thou shalt offer salt .
<unk> ....
In every sacrifice salt was to be used , which is an <unk> of wisdom and <unk> , without which none of our <unk> are agreeable to God .
But if thou offer a gift of the firstfruits of thy corn to the Lord , of the ears yet green , thou shalt dry it at the fire , and break it small like meal ; and so shalt thou offer thy firstfruits to the Lord :
<unk> oil upon it and putting on frankincense , because it is the oblation of the Lord .
<unk> the priest shall burn for a memorial of the gift , part of the corn broken small and of the oil , and all the frankincense .
Leviticus Chapter 3 Of peace offerings .
And if his oblation be a sacrifice of peace offerings , and he will offer of the herd , whether male or female : he shall offer them without blemish before the Lord .
Peace offerings .... Peace , in the scripture language , signifies happiness , welfare or prosperity ; in a word , all kind of blessings . — Such sacrifices , therefore , as were offered either on occasion of blessings received , or to obtain new favours , were called <unk> or peace offerings .
In these , some part of the victim was consumed with fire on the altar of God ; other parts were eaten by the priests and by the persons for whom the sacrifice was offered .
And he shall lay his hand upon the head of his victim , which shall be slain in the entry of the tabernacle of the testimony : and the sons of Aaron the priests shall pour the blood round about upon the altar .
And they shall offer of the sacrifice of peace offerings , for an oblation to the Lord : the fat that covereth the entrails , and all the fat that is within ,
The two kidneys with the fat wherewith the <unk> are covered , and the caul of the liver with the two little kidneys .
And they shall burn them upon the altar , for a holocaust , putting fire under the wood : for an oblation of most sweet savour to the Lord .
But if his oblation and the sacrifice of peace offering be of the flock , whether he offer male or female , they shall be without blemish .
If he offer a lamb before the Lord :
He shall put his hand upon the head of the victim .
And it shall be slain in the entry of the tabernacle of the testimony : and the sons of Aaron shall pour the blood thereof round about upon the altar .
And they shall offer of the victim of peace offerings , a sacrifice to the Lord : the fat and the whole <unk> ,
With the kidneys , and the fat that covereth the belly and all the <unk> and both the little kidneys , with the fat that is about the <unk> , and the caul of the liver with the little kidneys .
And the priest shall burn them upon the altar , for the food of the fire , and of the oblation of the Lord .
If his offering be a goat , and he offer it to the Lord :
He shall put his hand upon the head thereof : and shall immolate it in the entry of the tabernacle of the testimony .
And the sons of Aaron shall pour the blood thereof round about upon the altar .
And they shall take of it for the food of the Lord ’ s fire , the fat that covereth the belly , and that covereth all the <unk> parts :
The two little kidneys with the caul that is upon them which is by the <unk> , and the fat of the liver with the little kidneys .
And the priest shall burn them upon the altar , for the food of the fire , and of a most sweet savour .
All the fat shall be the Lord ’ s .
By a perpetual law for your generations , and in all your habitations : neither blood nor fat shall you eat at all .
<unk> ....
It is meant of the fat , which by the <unk> of the law was to be offered on God ’ s altar ; not of the fat of meat , such as we commonly eat .
Leviticus Chapter 4 Of offerings for sins of ignorance .
And the Lord spoke to Moses , saying :
Say to the children of Israel : The soul that sinneth through ignorance , and doth any thing concerning any of the commandments of the Lord , which he commanded not to be done : <unk> .... To be ignorant of what we are bound to know is sinful ; and for such <unk> ignorance , these sacrifices , <unk> in this and the following chapter , were appointed .
If the priest that is anointed shall sin , making the people to offend , he shall offer to the Lord for his sin a calf without blemish .
And he shall bring it to the door of the testimony before the Lord : and shall put his hand upon the head thereof , and shall sacrifice it to the Lord .
He shall take also of the blood of the calf : and carry it into the tabernacle of the testimony .
The blood .... As the figure of the blood of Christ shed for the remission of our sins , and carried by him into the sanctuary of heaven .
And having <unk> his finger in the blood , he shall sprinkle with it seven times before the Lord , before the veil of the sanctuary .
And he shall put some of the same blood upon the horns of the altar of the sweet incense most acceptable to the Lord , which is in the tabernacle of the testimony .
And he shall pour all the rest of the blood at the foot of the altar of holocaust in the entry of the tabernacle .
And he shall take off the fat of the calf for the sin offering , as well that which covereth the entrails , as all the <unk> :
The two little kidneys , and the caul that is upon them , which is by the <unk> , and the fat of the liver with the little kidneys :
As it is taken off from the calf of the sacrifice of peace offerings .
And he shall burn them upon the altar of holocaust .
But the skin and all the flesh with the head and the feet and the bowels and the dung :
And the rest of the body , he shall carry forth without the camp into a clean place where the ashes are wont to be poured out : and he shall burn them upon a <unk> of wood .
They shall be burnt in the place where the ashes are poured out .
And if all the multitude of Israel shall be ignorant , and through ignorance shall do that which is against the commandment of the Lord ,
And afterwards shall understand their sin : they shall offer for their sin a calf , and shall bring it to the door of the tabernacle .
And the ancients of the people shall put their hands upon the head thereof before the Lord .
And the calf being immolated in the sight of the Lord :
The priest that is anointed shall carry of the blood into the tabernacle of the testimony .
And shall dip his finger in it and sprinkle it seven times before the veil .
And he shall put of the same blood on the horns of the altar that is before the Lord , in the tabernacle of the testimony .
And the rest of the blood he shall pour at the foot of the altar of holocaust , which is at the door of the tabernacle of the testimony .
And all the fat thereof he shall take off , and shall burn it upon the altar :
<unk> so with this calf , as he did also with that before .
And the priest praying for them , the Lord will be merciful unto them .
But the calf itself he shall carry forth without the camp , and shall burn it as he did the former calf : because it is for the sin of the multitude .
If a prince shall sin , and through ignorance do any one of the things that the law of the Lord <unk> ,
And afterwards shall come to know his sin : he shall offer a buck goat without blemish , a sacrifice to the Lord .
And he shall put his hand upon the head thereof : and when he hath immolated it in the place where the holocaust is wont to be slain before the Lord , because it is for sin ,
The priest shall dip his finger in the blood of the victim for sin , touching therewith the horns of the altar of holocaust , and pouring out the rest at the foot thereof .
But the fat he shall burn upon it , as is wont to be done with the victims of peace offerings .
And the priest shall pray for him , and for his sin : and it shall be forgiven him .
And if any one of the people of the land shall sin through ignorance , doing any of those things that by the law of the Lord are forbidden , and <unk> ,
And shall come to know his sin : he shall offer a she goat without blemish .
And he shall put his hand upon the head of the victim that is for sin : and shall immolate it in the place of the holocaust .
And the priest shall take of the blood with his finger , and shall touch the horns of the altar of holocaust : and shall pour out the rest at the foot thereof .
But taking off all the fat , as is wont to be taken away of the victims of peace offerings , he shall burn it upon the altar , for a sweet savour to the Lord : and he shall pray for him , and it shall be forgiven him .
But if he offer of the flock a victim for his sin , to wit , an <unk> without blemish :
He shall put his hand upon the head thereof , and shall immolate it in the place where the victims of holocausts are wont to be slain .
And the priest shall take of the blood thereof with his finger , and shall touch the horns of the altar of holocaust : and the rest he shall pour out at the foot thereof .
All the fat also he shall take off , as the fat of the ram that is offered for peace offerings is wont to be taken away : and shall burn it upon the altar , for a burnt sacrifice of the Lord .
And he shall pray for him and his sin , and it shall be forgiven him .
Leviticus Chapter 5 Of other sacrifices for sins .
If any one sin , and hear the voice of one <unk> , and is a witness either because he himself hath seen , or is <unk> to it : if he do not utter it , he shall bear his iniquity .
Whosoever toucheth any unclean thing , either that which hath been killed by a beast , or died of itself , or any other creeping thing : and <unk> his uncleanness , he is guilty , and hath offended .
And if he touch any thing of the uncleanness of man , according to any uncleanness wherewith he is wont to be defiled : and having forgotten it , come afterwards to know it , he shall be guilty of an offence .
The person that sweareth , and uttereth with his lips , that he would do either evil or good , and <unk> the same with an oath , and his word : and having forgotten it afterwards understandeth his offence ,
Let him do penance for his sin :
And offer of the flocks an <unk> lamb , or a she goat , and the priest shall pray for him and for his sin .
But if he be not able to offer a beast , let him offer two <unk> , or two young pigeons to the Lord , one for sin , and the other for a holocaust ,
And he shall give them to the priest : who shall offer the first for sin , and <unk> back the head of it to the little <unk> , so that it stick to the neck , and be not altogether broken off .
And of its blood he shall sprinkle the side of the altar : and whatever is left , he shall let it drop at the bottom thereof , because it is for sin .
And the other he shall burn for a holocaust , as is wont to be done .
And the priest shall pray for him , and for his sin , and it shall be forgiven him .
And if his hand be not able to offer two <unk> , or two young pigeons , he shall offer for his sin the tenth part of an ephi of flour .
He shall not put oil upon it , nor put any frankincense thereon , because it is for sin .
And he shall deliver it to the priest , who shall take a <unk> thereof , and shall burn it upon the altar for a memorial of him that offered it :
<unk> for him and making atonement .
But the part that is left , he himself shall have for a gift .
And the Lord spoke to Moses , saying :
If any one shall sin through <unk> , <unk> the ceremonies in those things that are sacrificed to the Lord , he shall offer for his offence a ram without blemish out of the flocks , that may be bought for two sicles , according to the weight of the sanctuary .
And he shall make good the damage itself which he hath done , and shall add the fifth part besides , delivering it to the priest , who shall pray for him , offering the ram : and it shall be forgiven him .
If any one sin through ignorance , and do one of those things which by the law of the Lord are forbidden , and being guilty of sin , understand his iniquity :
He shall offer of the flocks a ram without blemish to the priest , according to the measure and estimation of the sin .
And the priest shall pray for him , because he did it <unk> : And it shall be forgiven him ,
Because by <unk> he <unk> against the Lord .
Leviticus Chapter 6 <unk> for sins of injustice : ordinances concerning the holocausts and the perpetual fire : the sacrifices of the priests , and the sin offerings .
The Lord spoke to Moses , saying :
Whosoever shall sin , and <unk> the Lord , shall deny to his neighbour the thing delivered to his keeping , which was committed to his trust ; or shall by force <unk> any thing , or commit oppression ;
Or shall find a thing lost , and denying it , shall also swear falsely , or shall do any other of the many things , wherein men are wont to sin :
Being <unk> of the offence , he shall restore
All that he would have gotten by <unk> , in the principal , and the fifth part besides , to the owner , whom he wronged .
Moreover for his sin he shall offer a ram without blemish out of the flock : and shall give it to the priest , according to the estimation and measure of the offence .
And he shall pray for him before the Lord : and he shall have forgiveness for every thing in doing of which he <unk> sinned .
And the Lord spoke to Moses , saying :
Command Aaron and his sons : This is the law of a holocaust .
It shall be burnt upon the altar , all night until morning : the fire shall be of the same altar .
The priest shall be vested with the <unk> and the linen <unk> ; and he shall take up the ashes of that which the devouring fire hath burnt : and putting them beside the altar ,
Shall put off his former vestments , and being clothed with others , shall carry them forth without the camp , and shall cause them to be consumed to dust in a very clean place .
And the fire on the altar shall always burn , and the priest shall feed it , putting wood on it every day in the morning : and laying on the holocaust , shall burn <unk> the fat of the peace offerings .
This is the perpetual fire which shall never go out on the altar .
The perpetual fire ....
This fire came from heaven , ( <unk> .
chap .
<unk> , ) and was always kept burning on the altar , as a figure of the heavenly fire of divine love , which ought to be always burning in the heart of a Christian .
This is the law of the sacrifice and libations , which the children of Aaron shall offer before the Lord , and before the altar .
The priest shall take a <unk> of the flour that is tempered with oil , and all the frankincense that is put upon the flour : and he shall burn on the altar for a memorial of most sweet odour to the Lord .
And the part of the flour that is left , Aaron and his sons shall eat , without leaven : and he shall eat it in the holy place of the court of the tabernacle .
And therefore it shall not be leavened , because part thereof is offered for the burnt sacrifice of the Lord .
It shall be most holy , as that which is offered for sin and for trespass .
The males only of the race of Aaron shall eat it .
It shall be an ordinance everlasting in your generations concerning the sacrifices of the Lord : Every one that toucheth them shall be sanctified .
And the Lord spoke to Moses , saying :
This is the oblation of Aaron , and of his sons , which they must offer to the Lord , in the day of their <unk> .
They shall offer the tenth part of an ephi of flour for a perpetual sacrifice , half of it in the morning , and half of it in the evening .
It shall be tempered with oil , and shall be <unk> in a <unk> .
And the priest that <unk> <unk> his father , shall offer it hot , for a most sweet odour to the Lord : and it shall be wholly burnt on the altar .
For every sacrifice of the priest shall be consumed with fire : neither shall any man eat thereof .
And the Lord spoke to Moses , saying :
Say to Aaron and his sons : This is the law of the victim for sin .
In the place where the holocaust is offered , it shall be immolated before the Lord .
It is holy of holies .
The priest that offereth it , shall eat it in a holy place , in the court of the tabernacle .
Whatsoever shall touch the flesh thereof , shall be sanctified .
If a garment be sprinkled with the blood thereof , it shall be washed in a holy place .
And the earthen vessel , wherein it was <unk> , shall be broken : but if the vessel be of brass , it shall be <unk> , and washed with water .
Every male of the priestly race shall eat of the flesh thereof , because it is holy of holies .
For the victim that is slain for sin , the blood of which is carried into the tabernacle of the testimony to make atonement in the sanctuary , shall not be eaten , but shall be burnt with fire .
Leviticus Chapter 7 Of sacrifices for <unk> and thanks offerings .
No fat nor blood is to be eaten .
This also is the law of the sacrifice for a trespass : it is most holy .
<unk> .... <unk> , for which these offerings were to be made , were lesser offences than those for which the sin offerings were appointed .
Therefore where the holocaust is immolated , the victim also for a trespass shall be slain : the blood thereof shall be poured round about the altar .
They shall offer thereof the <unk> and the fat that covereth the entrails :
The two little kidneys , and the fat which is by the <unk> , and the caul of the liver with the little kidneys .
And the priest shall burn them upon the altar : it is the burnt sacrifice of the Lord for a trespass .
Every male of the priestly race , shall eat this flesh in a holy place , because it is most holy .
As the sacrifice for sin is offered , so is also that for a trespass : the same shall be the law of both these sacrifices .
It shall belong to the priest that offereth it .
The priest that offereth the victim of holocaust , shall have the skin thereof .
And every sacrifice of flour that is baked in the oven , and whatsoever is dressed on the <unk> , or in the <unk> , shall be the priest ’ s that offereth it .
Whether they be tempered with oil , or dry , all the sons of Aaron shall have one as much as another .
This is the law of the sacrifice of peace offerings that is offered to the Lord .
If the oblation be for thanksgiving , they shall offer loaves without leaven tempered with oil , and unleavened <unk> anointed with oil , and fine flour <unk> , and <unk> tempered and mingled with oil .
Moreover loaves of leavened bread with the sacrifice of thanks , which is offered for peace offerings :
Of which one shall be offered to the Lord for firstfruits , and shall be the priest ’ s that shall pour out the blood of the victim .
And the flesh of it shall be eaten the same day : neither shall any of it remain until the morning .
If any man by vow , or of his own accord offer a sacrifice , it shall in like manner be eaten the same day .
And if any of it remain until the morrow , it is lawful to eat it .
But whatsoever shall be found on the third day shall be consumed with fire .
If any man eat of the flesh of the victim of peace offerings on the third day , the oblation shall be of no effect : neither shall it profit the <unk> .
Yea rather , whatsoever soul shall defile itself with such meat , shall be guilty of transgression .
The flesh that hath touched any unclean thing , shall not be eaten : but shall be burnt with fire .
He that is clean shall eat of it .
If any one that is defiled shall eat of the flesh of the sacrifice of peace offerings , which is offered to the Lord , he shall be cut off from his people .
And he that hath touched the uncleanness of man , or of beast , or of any thing that can defile , and shall eat of such kind of flesh : shall be cut off from his people .
And the Lord spoke to Moses , saying :
Say to the children of Israel : The fat of a sheep , and of an ox , and of a goat you shall not eat .
The fat of a carcass that hath died of itself , and of a beast that was caught by another beast , you shall have for divers uses .
If any man eat the fat that should be offered for the burnt sacrifice of the Lord , he shall perish out of his people .
Moreover you shall not eat the blood of any creature whatsoever , whether of birds or beasts .
Every one that eateth blood , shall perish from among the people .
And the Lord spoke to Moses , saying :
Speak to the children of Israel , saying : He that offereth a victim of peace offerings to the Lord , let him offer therewith a sacrifice also , that is , the libations thereof .
He shall hold in his hands the fat of the victim , and the breast .
And when he hath offered and consecrated both to the Lord , he shall deliver them to the priest , 7 : 31 . Who shall burn the fat upon the altar .
But the breast shall be Aaron ’ s and his sons ’ .
The right shoulder also of the victim , of peace offerings shall fall to the priest for firstfruits .
He among the sons of Aaron , that offereth the blood , and the fat : he shall have the right shoulder also for his portion .
For the breast that is elevated and the shoulder that is separated I have taken of the children of Israel , from off their victims of peace offerings : and have given them to Aaron the priest , and to his sons , by a law for ever , from all the people of Israel .
This is the <unk> of Aaron and his sons , in the ceremonies of the Lord , in the day when Moses offered them , that they might do the office of priesthood ,
And the things that the Lord commanded to be given them by the children of Israel , by a perpetual observance in their generations .
This is the law of holocaust , and of the sacrifice for sin , and for trespass , and for consecration , and the victims of peace offerings :
Which the Lord appointed to Moses in mount Sinai , when he commanded the children of Israel , that they should offer their oblations to the Lord in the desert of Sinai .
Leviticus Chapter 8 Moses <unk> Aaron and his sons .
And the Lord spoke to Moses , saying :
Take Aaron with his sons , their vestments , and the oil of unction : a calf for sin , two rams , a basket with unleavened bread .
And thou shalt gather together all the congregation to the door of the tabernacle .
And Moses did as the Lord had commanded .
And all the multitude being gathered together before the door of the tabernacle :
He said : This is the word that the Lord hath commanded to be done .
And immediately , he offered Aaron and his sons .
And when he had washed them ,
He vested the high priest with the strait linen garment , <unk> him with the girdle , and putting on him the violet <unk> : and over it he put the ephod .
And binding it with the girdle , he <unk> it to the rational , on which was <unk> and <unk> .
He put also the mitre upon his head : and upon the mitre over the forehead , he put the <unk> of gold , consecrated with sanctification , as the Lord had commanded him .
He took also the oil of unction , with which he anointed the tabernacle , with all the furniture thereof .
And when he had sanctified and sprinkled the altar seven times , he anointed it , and all the vessels thereof : and the laver with the foot thereof , he sanctified with the oil .
And he poured it upon Aaron ’ s head : and he anointed and consecrated him .
And after he had offered his sons , he vested them with linen <unk> , and girded them with <unk> : and put <unk> on them as the Lord had commanded .
He offered also the calf for sin : and when Aaron and his sons had put their hands upon the head thereof ,
He immolated it : and took the blood , and <unk> his finger in it , he touched the horns of the altar round about .
Which being <unk> , and sanctified , he poured the rest of the blood at the bottom thereof .
But the fat that was upon the entrails , and the caul of the liver , and the two little kidneys , with their fat , he burnt upon the altar .
And the calf with the skin , and the flesh and the dung , he burnt without the camp , as the Lord had commanded .
He offered also a ram for holocaust .
And when Aaron and his sons had put their hands upon its head :
He immolated it , and poured the blood thereof round about the altar .
And <unk> the ram into pieces , the head thereof , and the joints , and the fat he burnt in the fire .
Having first washed the entrails , and the feet , and the whole ram together he burnt upon the altar : because it was a holocaust of most sweet odour to the Lord , as he had commanded him .
He offered also the second ram , in the consecration of priests : and Aaron , and his sons put their hands upon the head thereof .
And when Moses had immolated it , he took of the blood thereof , and touched the tip of Aaron ’ s right ear , and the <unk> of his right hand , and in like manner also the great <unk> of his right foot .
He offered also the sons of Aaron : and when with the blood of the ram that was immolated , he had touched the tip of the right ear of every one of them , and the <unk> of their right hands , and the great <unk> of their right feet , the rest he poured on the altar round about .
But the fat , and the <unk> , and all the fat that covereth the entrails , and the caul of the liver , and the two kidneys with their fat , and with the right shoulder , he separated .
And taking out of the basket of unleavened bread , which was before the Lord , a <unk> without leaven , and a <unk> tempered with oil and a <unk> , he put them upon the fat , and the right shoulder :
<unk> all to Aaron , and to his sons .
Who having lifted them up before the Lord ,
He took them again from their hands , and burnt them upon the altar of holocaust : because it was the oblation of consecration , for a sweet odour of sacrifice to the Lord .
And he took of the ram of consecration , the breast for his portion , <unk> it before the Lord , as the Lord had commanded him .
And taking the ointment , and the blood that was upon the altar , he sprinkled Aaron , and his vestments , and his sons , and their vestments with it .
And when he had sanctified them in their vestments , he commanded them , saying : <unk> the flesh before the door of the tabernacle , and there eat it .
Eat ye also the loaves of consecration , that are laid in the basket , as the Lord commanded me , saying : Aaron and his sons shall eat them .
And whatsoever shall be left of the flesh and the loaves , shall be consumed with fire .
And you shall not go out of the door of the tabernacle for seven days , until the day wherein the time of your consecration shall be expired .
For in seven days the consecration is finished :
As at this present it hath been done , that the rite of the sacrifice might be accomplished .
<unk> and night shall you remain in the tabernacle <unk> the watches of the Lord , lest you die .
For so it hath been commanded me .
And Aaron and his sons did all things which the Lord spoke by the hand of Moses .
Leviticus Chapter 9 Aaron offereth sacrifice for himself and the people .
Fire cometh from the Lord upon the altar .
And when the eighth day was come , Moses called Aaron and his sons , and the ancients of Israel , and said to Aaron :
Take of the herd a calf for sin , and a ram for a holocaust , both without blemish , and offer them before the Lord .
And to the children of Israel thou shalt say : Take ye a he goat for sin , and a calf , and a lamb , both of a year old , and without blemish for a holocaust .
Also a bullock and a ram for peace offerings .
And immolate them before the Lord , offering for the sacrifice of every one of them flour tempered with oil : for to day the Lord will appear to you .
They brought therefore all things that Moses had commanded before the door of the tabernacle : where when all the multitude stood ,
Moses said : This is the word , which the Lord hath commanded .
Do it , and his glory will appear to you .
And he said to Aaron : <unk> to the altar , and offer sacrifice for thy sin .
<unk> the holocaust , and pray for thyself and for the people : and when thou hast slain the people ’ s victim , pray for them , as the Lord hath commanded .
And forthwith Aaron , approaching to the altar , immolated the calf for his sin .
And his sons brought him the blood of it : and he <unk> his finger therein , and touched the horns of the altar , and poured the rest at the foot thereof .
And the fat , and the little kidneys , and the caul of the liver , which are for sin , he burnt upon the altar , as the Lord had commanded Moses .
But the flesh and skins thereof he burnt with fire without the camp .
He immolated also the victim of holocaust : and his sons brought him the blood thereof , which he poured round about on the altar .
And the victim being cut into pieces , they brought to him the head and all the members : all which he burnt with fire upon the altar .
Having first washed the entrails and the feet with water .
Then offering for the sin of the people , he slew the he goat : and <unk> the altar ,
He offered the holocaust .
<unk> in the sacrifice the libations , which are offered withal , and burning them upon the altar , besides the ceremonies of the morning holocaust .
He immolated also the bullock and the ram , and peace offerings of the people : and his sons brought him the blood , which he poured upon the altar round about .
The fat also of the bullock , and the <unk> of the ram , and the two little kidneys with their fat , and the caul of the liver ,
They put upon the breasts .
And after the fat was burnt upon the altar ,
Aaron separated their breasts , and the right shoulders , <unk> them before the Lord , as Moses had commanded .
And stretching forth his hands to the people , he blessed them .
And so the victims for sin , and the holocausts , and the peace offerings being finished , he came down .
And Moses and Aaron went into the tabernacle of the testimony , and afterwards came forth and blessed the people .
And the glory of the Lord appeared to all the multitude .
And , behold , a fire , coming forth from the Lord , devoured the holocaust , and the fat that was upon the altar : which when the multitude saw , they praised the Lord , falling on their faces .
Leviticus Chapter 10 Nadab and Abiu for offering strange fire , are burnt by fire .
<unk> are forbidden to drink wine , when they enter into the tabernacle .
The law of eating the holy things .
And Nadab and Abiu , the sons of Aaron , taking their censers , put fire therein , and incense on it , offering before the Lord strange fire : which was not commanded them .
And fire coming out from the Lord destroyed them : and they died before the Lord .
And Moses said to Aaron : This is what the Lord hath spoken .
I will be sanctified in them that approach to me : and I will be glorified in the sight of all the people .
And when Aaron heard this , he held his peace .
And Moses called Misael and <unk> , the sons of Oziel , the uncle of Aaron , and said to them : Go and take away your brethren from before the sanctuary , and carry them without the camp .
And they went forthwith and took them as they lay , vested with linen <unk> , and cast them forth , as had been commanded them .
And Moses said to Aaron , and to Eleazar and Ithamar , his sons : <unk> not your heads , and rend not your garments , lest perhaps you die , and indignation come upon all the congregation .
Let your brethren , and all the house of Israel , <unk> the burning which the Lord has kindled .
But you shall not go out of the door of the tabernacle : otherwise you shall perish , for the oil of the holy unction is on you .
And they did all things according to the precept of Moses .
The Lord also said to Aaron :
You shall not drink wine nor any thing that may make drunk , thou nor thy sons , when you enter into the tabernacle of the testimony , lest you die .
Because it is an everlasting precept ; through your generations :
And that you may have knowledge to <unk> between holy and <unk> , between unclean and clean :
And may teach the children of Israel all my ordinances which the Lord hath spoken to them by the hand of Moses .
And Moses spoke to Aaron , and to Eleazar and Ithamar , his sons that were left : Take the sacrifice that is remaining of the oblation of the Lord , and eat it without leaven beside the altar , because it is holy of holies .
And you shall eat it in a holy place : which is given to thee and thy sons of the oblations of the Lord , as it hath been commanded me .
The breast also that is offered , and the shoulder that is separated , you shall eat in a most clean place , thou and thy sons , and thy daughters with thee .
For they are set aside for thee and thy children , of the victims of peace offerings of the children of Israel .
Because they have elevated before the Lord the shoulder and the breast , and the fat that is burnt on the altar : and they belong to thee and to thy sons by a perpetual law , as the Lord hath commanded .
While these things were a doing , when Moses sought for the buck goat , that had been offered for sin , he found it burnt .
And being angry with Eleazar and Ithamar , the sons of Aaron that were left , he said :
Why did you not eat in the holy place the sacrifice for sin , which is most holy , and given to you , that you may bear the iniquity of the people , and may pray for them in the sight of the Lord .
<unk> , whereas none of the blood thereof hath been carried within the holy places : and you ought to have eaten it in the sanctuary , as was commanded me ?
Aaron answered : This day hath been offered the victim for sin , and the holocaust before the Lord : and to me what thou seest has happened .
How could I eat it , or please the Lord in the ceremonies , having a sorrowful heart ?
Which when Moses had heard he was satisfied .
Leviticus Chapter 11 The distinction of clean and unclean animals .
And the Lord spoke to Moses and Aaron , saying :
Say to the children of Israel : These are the animals which you are to eat of all the living things of the earth .
<unk> which you are to eat , etc ....
The <unk> of so many kinds of beasts , birds , and fishes , in the law , was ordered , <unk> , to exercise the people in obedience , and <unk> ; <unk> , to <unk> them from the <unk> of which these animals were <unk> ; <unk> , because the things here forbidden were for the most part <unk> , and not proper to be eaten ; <unk> , that the people of God , by being obliged to abstain from things <unk> unclean , might be <unk> up to seek a spiritual cleanness .
Whatsoever hath the hoof divided , and <unk> the cud among the beasts , you shall eat .
<unk> divided , and <unk> the cud ....
The <unk> of the hoof and <unk> of the cud , signify <unk> between good and evil , and <unk> on the law of God ; and where either of these is wanting a man is unclean .
In like manner fishes were reputed unclean that had not <unk> and scales : that is , souls that did not raise themselves up by prayer and cover themselves with the scales of virtue .
But whatsoever <unk> indeed the cud , and hath a hoof , but divideth it not , as the camel , and others : that you shall not eat , but shall <unk> it among the unclean .
The <unk> which <unk> the cud , but divideth not the hoof , is unclean .
The <unk> ....
Some suppose it to be the <unk> , others the <unk> .
St. Jerome <unk> that it is another kind of <unk> common in <unk> , which lives in the holes of rocks or in the earth .
We choose here , as also in the names of several other creatures that follow ( which are little known in this part of the world , ) to keep the Greek or Latin names .
The <unk> also : for that too <unk> the cud , but divideth not the hoof .
And the swine , which , though it divideth the hoof , <unk> not the cud .
The flesh of these you shall not eat , nor shall you touch their carcasses , because they are unclean to you .
These are the things that <unk> in the waters , and which it is lawful to eat .
All that hath <unk> , and scales , as well in the sea , as in the rivers , and the <unk> , you shall eat .
But whatsoever hath not <unk> and scales , of those things that move and live in the waters , shall be an abomination to you ,
And <unk> .
Their flesh you shall not eat : and their carcasses you shall avoid .
All that have not <unk> and scales , in the waters , shall be unclean .
Of birds these are they which you must not eat , and which are to be <unk> by you : The eagle , and the <unk> , and the <unk> .
The <unk> .... Not the <unk> which the <unk> represent , which hath no being upon earth ; but a bird of the eagle kind , <unk> than the common .
And the <unk> , and the <unk> , according to their kind .
And all that is of the raven kind , according to their likeness .
The <unk> , and the <unk> , and the <unk> , and the <unk> according to its kind .
The <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> , and the <unk> .
And the <unk> , and the <unk> , and the <unk> .
The <unk> , and the <unk> according to its kind , the <unk> also , and the <unk> .
Of things that fly , whatsoever goeth upon four feet , shall be abominable to you .
But whatsoever walketh upon four feet , but hath the legs behind longer , wherewith it <unk> upon the earth ,
That you shall eat : as the <unk> in its kind , the <unk> , and <unk> , and the locust , every one according to their kind .
But of flying things whatsoever hath four feet only , shall be an abomination to you .
And whosoever shall touch the carcasses of them , shall be defiled : and shall be unclean until the evening :
And if it be necessary that he carry any of these things when they are dead : he shall wash his clothes , and shall be unclean until the sun set .
Every beast that hath a hoof , but divideth it not , nor <unk> the cud shall be unclean : and he that toucheth it , shall be defiled .
That which walketh upon hands of all animals which go on all four , shall be unclean : he that shall touch their carcasses shall be defiled until evening .
And he that shall carry such carcasses , shall wash his clothes , and shall be unclean until evening : because all these things are unclean to you .
These also shall be reckoned among unclean things , of all that move upon the earth .
The <unk> , and the <unk> , and the <unk> , every one according to their kind :
The <unk> , and the <unk> , and the <unk> , and the <unk> , and the <unk> .
All these are unclean .
He that toucheth their carcasses shall be unclean until the evening .
And upon what thing soever any of their carcasses shall fall , it shall be defiled , whether it be a vessel of wood , or a garment , or skins or <unk> : or any thing in which work is done .
They shall be <unk> in water , and shall be unclean until the evening , and so afterwards shall be clean .
But an earthen vessel , into which any of these shall fall , shall be defiled : and therefore is to be broken .
<unk> meat which you eat , if water from such a vessel be poured upon it , shall be unclean ; and every <unk> that is drunk out of any such vessel , shall be unclean .
And upon whatsoever thing any of these dead beasts shall fall , it shall be unclean .
Whether it be oven , or pots with feet , they shall be destroyed , and shall be unclean .
But fountains and <unk> , and all <unk> together of waters shall be clean .
He that toucheth their carcasses shall be defiled .
If it fall upon seed corn , it shall not defile it .
But if any man pour water upon the seed , and afterwards it be touched by the carcasses , it shall be forthwith defiled .
If any beast die , of which it is lawful for you to eat , he that toucheth the carcass thereof , shall be unclean until the evening .
And he that eateth or <unk> any thing thereof , shall wash his clothes , and shall be unclean until the evening .
All that <unk> upon the earth shall be abominable : neither shall it be taken for meat .
Whatsoever goeth upon the breast on four feet , or hath many feet , or <unk> on the earth , you shall not eat , because it is abominable .
Do not defile your souls , nor touch <unk> thereof , lest you be unclean ,
For I am the Lord your God .
Be holy because I am holy .
<unk> not your souls by any creeping thing , that <unk> upon the earth .
For I am the Lord , who brought you out of the land of Egypt , that I might be your God .
You shall be holy , because I am holy .
This is the law of beasts and fowls , and of every living creature that <unk> in the waters , and <unk> on the earth :
That you may know the <unk> of the clean , and unclean , and know what you ought to eat , and what to refuse .
Leviticus Chapter 12 The purification of women after <unk> .
And the Lord spoke to Moses , saying :
Speak to the children of Israel , and thou shalt say to them : If a woman having received seed shall bear a man child , she shall be unclean seven days , according to the days of separation of her flowers .
And on the eighth day the infant shall be circumcised :
But she shall remain three and thirty days in the blood of her purification .
She shall touch no holy thing : neither shall she enter into the sanctuary , until the days of her purification , be fulfilled .
But if she shall bear a maid child , she shall be unclean two weeks , according to the custom of her <unk> courses .
And she shall remain in the blood of her purification <unk> days .
And when the days of her purification are expired , for a son , or for a daughter , she shall bring to the door of the tabernacle of the testimony , a lamb of a year old for a holocaust , and a young <unk> or a <unk> for sin : and shall deliver them to the priest .
12 : 7 . Who shall offer them before the Lord , and shall pray for her : and so she shall be cleansed from the issue of her blood .
This is the law for her that beareth a man child or a maid child .
And if her hand find not <unk> , and she is not able to offer a lamb , she shall take two <unk> , or two young pigeons , one for a holocaust , and another for sin : and the priest shall pray for her , and so she shall be cleansed .
Leviticus Chapter 13 The law concerning leprosy in men , and in garments .
And the Lord spoke to Moses and Aaron , saying :
The man in whose skin or flesh shall arise a different colour or a <unk> , or as it were something shining , that is the stroke of the leprosy , shall be brought to Aaron the priest , or any one of his sons .
And if he see the leprosy in his skin , and the hair turned white and the place where the leprosy appears lower than the skin and the rest of the flesh : it is the stroke of the leprosy , and upon his judgment he shall be separated .
But if there be a shining <unk> in the skin , and not lower than the other flesh , and the hair be of the former colour , the priest shall shut him up seven days .
And the seventh day he shall look on him : and if the leprosy be grown no farther , and hath not spread itself in the skin , he shall shut him up again other seven days .
And on the seventh day , he shall look on him .
If the leprosy be somewhat obscure , and not spread in the skin , he shall declare him clean , because it is but a <unk> : and the man shall wash his clothes , and shall be clean .
But , if the leprosy grow again , after he was seen by the priest and restored to cleanness , he shall be brought to him :
And shall be condemned of uncleanness .
If the stroke of the leprosy be in a man , he shall be brought to the priest :
And he shall view him .
And when there shall be a white colour in the skin , and it shall have changed the look of the hair , and the living flesh itself shall appear :
It shall be judged an <unk> leprosy , and grown into the skin .
The priest therefore shall declare him unclean : and shall not shut him up , because he is <unk> unclean .
But if the leprosy spring out running about in the skin , and cover all the skin from the head to the feet , whatsoever falleth under the sight of the eyes :
The priest shall view him , and shall judge that the leprosy which he has is very clean : because it is all turned into <unk> , and therefore the man shall be clean .
But when the live flesh shall appear in him :
Then by the judgment of the priest he shall be defiled , and shall be reckoned among the unclean .
For live flesh , if it be spotted with leprosy , is unclean .
And if again it be turned into <unk> , and cover all the man :
The priest shall view him , and shall judge him to be clean .
When also there has been an <unk> in the flesh and the skin , and it has been healed :
And in the place of the <unk> , there appeareth a white <unk> , or somewhat red , the man shall be brought to the priest .
And when he shall see the place of the leprosy lower than the other flesh , and the hair turned white : he shall declare him unclean , for the plague of leprosy is broken out in the <unk> .
But if the hair be of the former colour , and the <unk> somewhat obscure , and be not lower than the flesh that is near it : he shall shut him up seven days .
And if it spread , he shall judge him to have the leprosy :
But if it stay in its place , it is but the <unk> of an <unk> : and the man shall be clean .
The flesh also and skin that hath been burnt , and after it is healed hath a white or a red <unk> :
The priest shall view it , and if he see it turned white , and the place thereof is lower than the other skin : he shall declare him unclean , because the evil of leprosy is broken out in the <unk> .
But if the colour of the hair be not changed , nor the blemish lower than the other flesh , and the appearance of the leprosy be somewhat obscure : he shall shut him up seven days ,
And on the seventh day he shall view him .
If the leprosy be grown farther in the skin , he shall declare him unclean .
But if the <unk> stay in its place , and be not very clear , it is the <unk> of a burning : and therefore he shall be cleansed , because it is only the <unk> of a burning .
If the leprosy break out in the head or the beard of a man or woman , the priest shall see them ,
And if the place be lower than the other flesh , and the hair <unk> , and <unk> than usual : he shall declare them unclean , because it is the leprosy of the head and the beard ;
But if he perceive the place of the spot is equal with the flesh that is near it , and the hair black : he shall shut him up seven days ,
And on the seventh day he shall look upon it .
If the spot be not grown , and the hair keep its colour , and the place of the blemish be even with the other flesh :
The man shall be <unk> all but the place of the spot : and he shall be shut up other seven days .
If on the seventh day the evil seem to have stayed in its place , and not lower than the other flesh , he shall cleanse him : and his clothes being washed he shall be clean .
But if after his cleansing the spot spread again in the skin :
He shall seek no more whether the hair be turned <unk> , because he is <unk> unclean .
But if the spot be stayed , and the hair be black , let him know that the man is healed : and let him confidently <unk> him clean .
If a <unk> appear in the skin of a man or a woman ,
The priest shall view them .
If he find that a <unk> <unk> shineth in the skin , let him know that it is not the leprosy , but a white blemish , and that the man is clean .
The man whose hair falleth off from his head , he is bald and clean :
And if the hair fall from his forehead , he is bald before and clean .
But if in the bald head or in the bald forehead there be risen a white or <unk> colour :
And the priest perceive this , he shall condemn him <unk> of leprosy which is risen in the bald part .
Now whosoever shall be defiled with the leprosy , and is separated by the judgment of the priest :
Shall have his clothes hanging loose , his head bare , his mouth covered with a cloth : and he shall cry out that he is defiled and unclean .
All the time that he is a leper and unclean he shall dwell alone without the camp .
A <unk> or linen garment that shall have the leprosy
In the <unk> , and the <unk> : or skin , or whatsoever is made of a skin :
If it be <unk> with a white or red spot , it shall be accounted the leprosy , and shall be shewn to the priest .
And he shall look upon it and shall shut it up seven days .
And on the seventh day when he looketh on it again , if he find that it is grown , it is a fixed leprosy .
He shall judge the garment unclean , and every thing wherein it shall be found .
And therefore it shall be burnt with fire .
But if he see that it is not grown ,
He shall give orders , and they shall wash that part wherein the leprosy is : and he shall shut it up other seven days .
And when he shall see that the former colour is not returned , nor yet the leprosy spread , he shall judge it unclean : and shall burn it with fire , for the leprosy has taken hold of the outside of the garment , or through the whole .
But if the place of the leprosy be somewhat dark , after the garment is washed , he shall tear it off , and divide it from that which is sound .
And if after this there appear in those places that before were without spot , a flying and wandering leprosy : it must be burnt with fire .
If it cease , he shall wash with water the parts that are pure , the second time : and they shall be clean .
This is the law touching the leprosy of any <unk> or linen garment , either in the <unk> or <unk> , or any thing of skins : how it ought to be <unk> , or pronounced unclean .
Leviticus Chapter 14 The rites of sacrifices in cleansing the leprosy .
<unk> in houses .
And the Lord spoke to Moses , saying :
This is the rite of a leper , when he is to be cleansed .
He shall be brought to the priest : 14 : 3 . Who going out of the camp , when he shall find that the leprosy is cleansed ,
Shall command him that is to be purified , to offer for himself two living <unk> , which it is lawful to eat , and cedar wood , and scarlet , and hyssop .
And he shall command one of the <unk> to be immolated in an earthen vessel over living waters .
<unk> waters .... That is , waters taken from a spring , brook , or river .
But the other that is alive , he shall dip , with the cedar wood , and the scarlet and the hyssop , in the blood of the sparrow that is immolated :
<unk> he shall sprinkle him that is to be cleansed seven times , that he may be rightly purified .
And he shall let go the living sparrow , that it may fly into the field .
And when the man hath washed his clothes , he shall shave all the hair of his body , and shall be washed with water : and being purified he shall enter into the camp , yet so that he tarry without his own tent seven days .
And on the seventh day he shall shave the hair of his head , and his beard and his <unk> , and the hair of all his body .
And having washed again his clothes , and his body ,
On the eighth day , he shall take two lambs without blemish , and an <unk> of a year old without blemish , and three tenths of flour tempered with oil for a sacrifice , and a <unk> of oil apart .
A <unk> .... Heb .
<unk> : a measure of <unk> , which was the twelfth part of a hin ; and held about as much as six <unk> .
And when the priest that <unk> the man , hath presented him , and all these things before the Lord , at the door of the tabernacle of the testimony :
He shall take a lamb , and offer it for a trespass offering with the <unk> of oil .
And having offered all before the Lord ,
He shall immolate the lamb , where the victim for sin is wont to be immolated , and the holocaust , that is , in the holy place .
For as that which is for sin , so also the victim for a trespass offering <unk> to the priest : it is holy of holies .
And the priest taking of the blood of the victim that was immolated for trespass , shall put it upon the tip of the right ear of him that is cleansed , and upon the <unk> of his right hand and the great <unk> of his right foot .
<unk> of the blood , etc ....
These ceremonies used in the cleansing of a leper , were <unk> and very <unk> .
The <unk> seven times with the blood of the little bird , the washing himself and his clothes , the <unk> his hair and his beard , signify the means which are to be used in the reconciliation of a sinner , and the steps by which he is to return to God , viz . , by the repeated <unk> of the blood of Christ : the washing his conscience with the waters of <unk> : and <unk> all vanities and <unk> , by <unk> all that is over and above what is necessary in alms deeds .
The sin offering , and the holocaust or burnt offering , which he was to offer at his cleansing , signify the sacrifice of a <unk> and humble heart , and that of <unk> in spirit and truth , with <unk> and <unk> , for the forgiveness of sins , with which we are ever to appear before the Almighty .
The touching the right ear , the <unk> of the right hand , and the great <unk> of the right foot , first with the blood of the victim , and then with the <unk> of the oil , which had been sprinkled seven times before the Lord , signify the <unk> of the blood of Christ , and the unction of the sevenfold grace of the Holy Ghost ; to the sinner ’ s right ear , that he may <unk> hearken to and obey the law of God ; and to his right hand and foot , that the works of his hands , and all the steps or <unk> of his soul , signified by the feet , may be rightly directed to God .
And he shall pour of the <unk> of oil into his own left hand ,
And shall dip his right finger in it , and sprinkle it before the Lord seven times .
And the rest of the oil in his left hand , he shall pour upon the tip of the right ear of him that is cleansed , and upon the <unk> of his right hand and the great <unk> of his right foot , and upon the blood that was shed for trespass :
And upon his head .
And he shall pray for him before the Lord , and shall offer the sacrifice for sin .
Then shall he immolate the holocaust .
And put it on the altar with the libations thereof : and the man shall be rightly cleansed .
But if he be poor , and his hand cannot find the things aforesaid : he shall take a lamb for an offering for trespass , that the priest may pray for him , and a tenth part of flour tempered with oil for a sacrifice , and a <unk> of oil :
And two <unk> or two young pigeons , of which one may be for sin , and the other for a holocaust .
And he shall offer them on the eighth day of his purification to the priest , at the door of the tabernacle of the testimony before the Lord .
And the priest receiving the lamb for trespass , and the <unk> of oil , shall <unk> them together .
And the lamb being immolated , he shall put of the blood thereof upon the tip of the right ear of him that is cleansed , and upon the <unk> of his right hand , and the great <unk> of his right foot .
But he shall pour part of the oil into his own left hand ,
And <unk> the finger of his right hand in it , he shall sprinkle it seven times before the Lord .
And he shall touch the tip of the right ear of him that is cleansed , and the <unk> of his right hand and the great <unk> of his right foot , in the place of the blood that was shed for trespass .
And the other part of the oil that is in his left hand , he shall pour upon the head of the purified person , that he may <unk> the Lord for him .
And he shall offer a <unk> , or young <unk> :
One for trespass , and the other for a holocaust , with their libations .
This is the sacrifice of a leper , that is not able to have all things that <unk> to his cleansing .
And the Lord spoke to Moses and Aaron , saying :
When you shall come into the land of Chanaan , which I will give you for a possession , if there be the plague of leprosy in a house :
He whose house it is , shall go and tell the priest , saying : It seemeth to me , that there is the plague of leprosy in my house ,
And he shall command , that they carry forth all things out of the house , before he go into it , and see whether it have the leprosy , let all things become unclean that are in the house .
And afterwards he shall go in to view the leprosy of the house .
And if he see in the walls thereof as it were little <unk> , <unk> with <unk> or <unk> , and lower than all he rest :
He shall go out of the door of the house , and forthwith shut it up seven days ,
And returning on the seventh day , he shall look upon it .
If he find that the leprosy is spread ,
He shall command , that the stones wherein the leprosy is , be taken out , and cast without the city into an unclean place :
And that the house be <unk> on the <unk> round about , and the dust of the <unk> be scattered without the city into an unclean place :
And that other stones be laid in the place of them that were taken away , and the house be <unk> with other mortar .
But if after the stones be taken out , and the dust <unk> off , and it be <unk> with other earth .
The priest going in perceive that the leprosy is returned , and the walls full of <unk> , it is a <unk> leprosy , and the house is unclean .
And they shall destroy it forthwith , and shall cast the stones and timber thereof , and all the dust without the town into an unclean place .
He that entereth into the house when it is shut , shall be unclean until evening ,
And he that sleepeth in it , and eateth any thing , shall wash his clothes .
But if the priest going in perceive that the leprosy is not spread in the house , after it was <unk> again , he shall purify it , it being cured .
And for the purification thereof he shall take two <unk> , and cedar wood , and scarlet , and hyssop .
And having immolated one sparrow in an earthen vessel , over living waters ,
He shall take the cedar wood , and the hyssop , and the scarlet , and the living sparrow , and shall dip all in the blood of the sparrow that is immolated , and in the living water : and he shall sprinkle the house seven times .
And shall purify it as well with the blood of the sparrow , as with the living water , and with the living sparrow , and with the cedar wood , and the hyssop , and the scarlet .
And when he hath let go the sparrow to fly freely away into the field , he shall pray for the house : and it shall be rightly cleansed .
This is the law of every kind of leprosy and stroke .
Of the leprosy of garments and houses ,
Of a <unk> and of <unk> breaking out of a shining spot , and when the colours are <unk> changed :
That it may be known when a thing is clean or unclean .
Leviticus Chapter 15 Other <unk> uncleannesses .
And the Lord spoke to Moses and Aaron , saying :
Speak to the children of Israel , and say to them : The man that hath an issue of seed , shall be unclean .
<unk> of seed shall be unclean ....
These <unk> uncleannesses were <unk> in order to give the people a horror of carnal <unk> .
And then shall he be judged subject to this evil , when a filthy <unk> , at every moment , <unk> to his flesh , and gathereth there .

Leviticus Chapter 16 When and how the high priest must enter into the sanctuary .
The feast of expiation .
And the Lord spoke to Moses , after the death of the two sons of Aaron when they were slain upon their offering strange fire :
And he commanded him , saying : Speak to Aaron thy brother , that he enter not at all into the sanctuary , which is within the veil before the propitiatory , with which the ark is covered , lest he die , ( for I will appear in a cloud over the oracle ) , <unk> not .... No one but the high priest , and he but once a year , could enter into the sanctuary ; to signify that no one could enter into the sanctuary of heaven , till Christ our high priest opened it by his passion .
Heb .
<unk> .
Unless he first do these things .
He shall offer a calf for sin , and a ram for a holocaust .
He shall be vested with a linen <unk> : he shall cover his nakedness with linen <unk> : he shall be girded with a linen girdle , and he shall put a linen mitre upon his head .
For these are holy vestments : all which he shall put on , after he is washed .
And he shall receive from the whole multitude of the children of Israel two buck goats for sin , and one ram for a holocaust .
And when he hath offered the cattle and prayed for himself and for his own house :
He shall make the two buck goats to stand before the Lord in the door of the tabernacle of the testimony .
And casting lots upon them both , one to be offered to the Lord , and the other to be the <unk> goat :
That whose lot fell to be offered to the Lord , he shall offer for sin .
But that whose lot was to be the <unk> goat , he shall present before the Lord , that he may pour prayers upon him , and let him go into the wilderness .
After these things are <unk> celebrated , he shall offer the calf : and praying for himself and for his own house , he shall immolate it .
And taking the <unk> , which he hath filled with the burning coals of the altar , and taking up with his hands the <unk> <unk> for incense , he shall go in within the veil into the holy place :
That when the <unk> are put upon the fire , the cloud and <unk> thereof may cover the oracle , which is over the testimony , and he may not die .
He shall take also of the blood of the calf , and sprinkle with his finger seven times towards the propitiatory to the east .
And when he hath killed the buck goat for the sin of the people , he shall carry in the blood thereof within the veil , as he was commanded to do with the blood of the calf , that he may sprinkle it over against the oracle :
And may <unk> the sanctuary from the uncleanness of the children of Israel , and from their transgressions , and all their sins .
According to this rite shall he do to the tabernacle of the testimony , which is fixed among them in the midst of the filth of their habitation .
Let no man be in the tabernacle when the high priest goeth into the sanctuary , to pray for himself and his house , and for the whole congregation of Israel , until he come out .
And when he is come out to the altar that is before the Lord , let him pray for himself : and taking the blood of the calf , and of the buck goat , let him pour it upon the horns thereof round about .
And <unk> with his finger seven times , let him <unk> , and sanctify it from the uncleanness of the children of Israel .
After he hath <unk> the sanctuary , and the tabernacle , and the altar , then let him offer the living goat .
And putting both hands upon his head , let him confess all the iniquities of the children of Israel , and all their offences and sins .
And praying that they may light on its head , he shall turn him out by a man ready for it , into the desert .
And when the goat hath carried all their iniquities into an <unk> land , and shall be let go into the desert :
Aaron shall return into the tabernacle of the testimony , and putting off the vestments , which he had on him before when he entered into the sanctuary , and leaving them there ,
He shall wash his flesh in the holy place , and shall put on his own garments .
And after that he is come out and hath offered his own holocaust , and that of the people , he shall pray both for himself , and for the people .
And the fat that is offered for sins , he shall burn on the altar .
But he that hath let go the <unk> goat , shall wash his clothes , and his body with water , and so shall enter into the camp .
But the calf and the buck goat , that were sacrificed for sin , and whose blood was carried into the sanctuary , to accomplish the atonement , they shall carry forth without the camp , and shall burn with fire : their skins and their flesh , and their dung .
And whosoever <unk> them shall wash his clothes , and flesh with water : and so shall enter into the camp .
And this shall be to you an everlasting ordinance .
The seventh month , the tenth day of the month , you shall afflict your souls , and shall do no work , whether it be one of your own country , or a stranger that <unk> among you .
Upon this day shall be the expiation for you , and the cleansing from all your sins .
You shall be cleansed before the Lord .
For it is a sabbath of rest : and you shall afflict your souls by a perpetual religion .
And the priest that is anointed , and whose hands are consecrated to do the office of the priesthood in his father ’ s stead , shall make atonement .
And he shall be vested with the linen robe and the holy vestments .
And he shall <unk> the sanctuary and the tabernacle of the testimony and the altar : the priest also and all the people .
And this shall be an ordinance for ever , that you pray for the children of Israel , and for all their sins once a year .
He did therefore as the Lord had commanded Moses .
Leviticus Chapter 17 No sacrifices to be offered but at the door of the tabernacle : a <unk> of blood .
And the Lord spoke to Moses , saying :
Speak to Aaron and his sons , and to all the children of Israel , saying to them : This is the word , which the Lord hath commanded , saying :
<unk> man whosoever of the house of Israel , if he kill an ox , or a sheep , or a goat in the camp , or without the camp , If he kill , etc .... That is , in order to sacrifice .
The law of God <unk> sacrifices to be offered in any other place but at the tabernacle or temple of the Lord ; to signify that no sacrifice would be acceptable to God , out of his true temple , the one holy , <unk> , <unk> church .
And offer it not at the door of the tabernacle an oblation to the Lord , shall be guilty of blood .
As if he had shed blood , so shall he perish from the midst of his people .
Therefore the children of Israel shall bring to the priest their victims , which they kill in the field , that they may be sanctified to the Lord before the door of the tabernacle of the testimony : and they may sacrifice them for peace offerings to the Lord .
And the priest shall pour the blood upon the altar of the Lord , at the door of the tabernacle of the testimony : and shall burn the fat for a sweet odour to the Lord .
And they shall no more sacrifice their victims to devils , with whom they have committed fornication .
It shall be an ordinance for ever to them and to their posterity .
And thou shalt say to them : The man of the house of Israel , and of the strangers who sojourn among you , that offereth a holocaust or a victim ,
And bringeth it not to the door of the tabernacle of the testimony , that it may be offered to the Lord , shall perish from among his people .
If any man whosoever of the house of Israel , and of the strangers that sojourn among them , eat blood , I will set my face against his soul , and will cut him off from among his people .
Eat blood .... To eat blood was forbidden in the law ; partly , because God reserved it to himself , to be offered in sacrifices on the altar , as to the Lord of life and death ; and as a figure of the blood of Christ ; and partly , to give men a horror of shedding blood .
Gen. <unk> , 5 , 6 .
Because the life of the flesh is in the blood : and I have given it to you , that you may make atonement with it upon the altar for your souls , and the blood may be for an expiation of the soul .
Therefore I have said to the children of Israel : No soul of you , nor of the strangers that sojourn among you , shall eat blood .
<unk> man whosoever of the children of Israel , and of the strangers that sojourn among you , if by <unk> or <unk> , he take a wild beast or a bird , which is lawful to eat , let him pour out its blood , and cover it with earth .
For the life of all flesh is in the blood .
Therefore I said to the children of Israel : you shall not eat the blood of any flesh at all , because the life of the flesh is in the blood , and whosoever eateth it , shall be cut off .
The soul that eateth that which died of itself , or has been caught by a beast , whether he be one of your own country or a stranger , shall wash his clothes and himself with water , and shall be defiled until the evening : and in this manner he shall be made clean .
But if he do not wash his clothes , and his body , he shall bear his iniquity .
Leviticus Chapter 18 <unk> is <unk> in certain degrees of kindred : <unk> all <unk> lusts .
And the Lord spoke to Moses , saying :
Speak to the children of Israel , and thou shalt say to them : I am the Lord your God .
You shall not do according to the custom of the land of Egypt , in which you dwelt : neither shall you act according to the manner of the country of Chanaan , into which I will bring you .
Nor shall you walk in their ordinances .
You shall do my judgments , and shall observe my precepts , and shall walk in them .
I am the Lord your God .
Keep my laws and my judgments : which if a man do , he shall live in them , I am the Lord .

I am the Lord .
Thou shalt not lie with mankind as with <unk> : because it is an abomination .
Thou shalt not <unk> with any beast : neither shalt thou be defiled with it .
A woman shall not lie down to a beast , nor <unk> with it : because it is a heinous crime .
Because it is a heinous crime ....
In Hebrew , this word heinous crime is expressed by the word confusion , signifying the <unk> and <unk> of this abominable sin .
<unk> not yourselves with any of these things with which all the nations have been defiled , which I will cast out before you ,
And with which the land is defiled : the abominations of which I will visit , that it may vomit out its inhabitants .
Keep ye my ordinances and my judgments : and do not any of these abominations .
Neither any of your own nation , nor any stranger that <unk> among you .
For all these <unk> things the inhabitants of the land have done , that were before you , and have defiled it .
Beware then , lest in like manner , it vomit you also out , if you do the like things : as it <unk> out the nation that was before you .
Every soul that shall commit any of these abominations , shall perish from the midst of his people .
Keep my commandments .
Do not the things which they have done , that have been before you : and be not defiled therein .
I am the Lord your God .

The people of the land shall stone him .
And I will set my face against him : and I will cut him off from the midst of his people , because he hath given of his seed to Moloch , and hath defiled my sanctuary , and profaned my holy name .
And if the people of the land <unk> , and as it were little <unk> my commandment , let alone the man that hath given of his seed to Moloch , and will not kill him :
I will set my face against that man , and his kindred , and will cut off both him and all that consented with him , to commit fornication with Moloch , out of the midst of their people .
The soul that shall go aside after magicians , and soothsayers , and shall commit fornication with them : I will set my face against that soul , and destroy it out of the midst of its people .
<unk> yourselves , and be ye holy : because I am the Lord your God .

He shall be burnt alive with them : neither shall so great an abomination remain in the midst of you .
He that shall <unk> with any beast or cattle , dying let him die : the beast also ye shall kill .
The beast also ye shall kill ....
The killing of the beast was for the greater horror of the crime , and to prevent the remembrance of such abomination .
The woman that shall lie under any beast , shall be killed together with the same .
Their blood be upon them .
If any man take his sister , the daughter of his father , or the daughter of his mother , and see her nakedness , and she behold her brother ’ s shame : they have committed a crime .

A man , or woman , in whom there is a <unk> or <unk> spirit , dying let them die .
They shall stone them .
Their blood be upon them .
Leviticus Chapter 21 <unk> relating to the priests .
The Lord said also to Moses : Speak to the priests the sons of Aaron , and thou shalt say to them : Let not a priest <unk> an uncleanness at the death of his citizens .
An uncleanness ....
Viz . , such as was <unk> in laying out the dead body , or touching it ; or in going into the house , or <unk> at the <unk> , etc .
But only for his <unk> , such as are near in blood : that is to say , for his father and for his mother , and for his son , and for his daughter , for his brother also :
And for a <unk> sister , who hath had no husband .
But not even for the prince of his people shall he do any thing that may make him unclean .
Neither shall they shave their head , nor their beard , nor make <unk> in their flesh .
They shall be holy to their God , and shall not profane his name .
For they offer the burnt offering of the Lord , and the bread of their God : and therefore they shall be holy .
They shall not take to wife a harlot or a <unk> <unk> , nor one that has been put away from her husband : because they are consecrated to their God ,
And offer the loaves of proposition .
Let them therefore be holy because I also am holy : the Lord , who sanctify them .
If the daughter of a priest be taken in <unk> and dishonour the name of her father , she shall be burnt with fire .
The high priest , that is to say , the priest who is the greatest among his brethren , upon whose head the oil of unction hath been poured ; and whose hands have been consecrated for the priesthood ; and who hath been vested with the holy vestments .
He shall not uncover his head : he shall not rend his garments .
Nor shall he go in at all to any dead person : not even for his father , or his mother , shall he be defiled .
Neither shall he go out of the holy places , lest he defile the sanctuary of the Lord : because the oil of the holy unction of his God is upon him .
I am the Lord .
He shall take a virgin unto his wife .
But a widow or one that is <unk> , or defiled , or a harlot , he shall not take : but a maid of his own people .
He shall not <unk> the stock of his kindred with the common people of this nation : for I am the Lord who sanctify him .
And the Lord spoke to Moses , saying :
Say to Aaron : Whosoever of thy seed throughout their families , hath a blemish , he shall not offer bread to his God .
Neither shall he approach to minister to him : If he be blind ; if he be lame ; if he have a little , or a great , or a crooked <unk> ;
If his foot , or if his hand be broken ;
If he be <unk> ; or <unk> <unk> ; or have a <unk> in his eye , or a continual <unk> , or a dry <unk> in his body , or a <unk> .
Whosoever of the seed of Aaron the priest hath a blemish : he shall not approach to offer sacrifices to the Lord , nor bread to his God .
He shall eat nevertheless of the loaves that are offered in the sanctuary .
Yet so that he enter not within the veil , nor approach to the altar : because he hath a blemish , and he must not defile my sanctuary .
I am the Lord who sanctify them .
Moses , therefore spoke to Aaron , and to his sons and to all Israel , all the things that had been commanded him .
Leviticus Chapter 22 Who may eat the holy things : and what things may be offered .
And the Lord spoke to Moses saying :
Speak to Aaron and to his sons , that they beware of those things that are consecrated of the children of Israel : and defile not the name of the things sanctified to me , which they offer .
I am the Lord .
Say to them and to their posterity : Every man of your race , that <unk> to those things that are consecrated , and which the children of Israel have offered to the Lord , in whom there is uncleanness , shall perish before the Lord .
I am the Lord .
<unk> , etc ....
This is to give us to understand , with what purity of soul we are to approach to the blessed sacrament of which these meats that had been offered in sacrifice were a figure .
The man of the seed of Aaron , that is a leper , or that <unk> a running of the seed , shall not eat of those things that are sanctified to me , until he be healed .
He that toucheth any thing unclean by occasion of the dead : and he whose seed goeth from him as in generation :
And he that toucheth a creeping thing , or any unclean thing , the touching of which is <unk> :
Shall be unclean until the evening , and shall not eat those things that are sanctified .
But when he hath washed his flesh with water ,
And the sun is down , then being purified , he shall eat of the sanctified things , because it is his meat .
That which dieth of itself , and that which was taken by a beast , they shall not eat , nor be defiled therewith .
I am the Lord .
Let them keep my precepts , that they may not fall into sin , and die in the sanctuary , when they shall have defiled it .
I am the Lord who sanctify them .
No stranger shall eat of the sanctified things : a sojourner of the priests , or a hired servant , shall not eat of them .
But he whom the priest hath bought , and he that is his servant , born in his house , these shall eat of them .
If the daughter of a priest be married to any of the people , she shall not eat of those things that are sanctified nor of the firstfruits .
But if she be a widow , or <unk> , and having no children return to her father ’ s house , she shall eat of her father ’ s meats , as she was wont to do when she was a maid .
No stranger hath leave to eat of them .
He that eateth of the sanctified things through ignorance , shall add the fifth part with that which he ate , and shall give it to the priest into the sanctuary .
And they shall not profane the sanctified things of the children of Israel , which they offer to the Lord :
Lest perhaps they bear the iniquity of their trespass , when they shall have eaten the sanctified things .
I am the Lord who sanctify them .
And the Lord spoke to Moses , saying :
Speak to Aaron , and to his sons , and to all the children of Israel , and thou shalt say to them : The man of the house of Israel , and of the strangers who dwell with you , that offereth his oblation , either paying his vows , or offering of his own accord , whatsoever it be which he <unk> for a holocaust of the Lord ,
To be offered by you : it shall be a male without blemish of the <unk> , or of the sheep , or of the goats .
If it have a blemish you shall not offer it : neither shall it be acceptable .
The man that offereth a victim of peace offerings to the Lord , either paying his vows , or offering of his own accord , whether of <unk> or of sheep , shall offer it without blemish , that it may be acceptable .
There shall be no blemish in it .
If it be blind , or broken , or have a <unk> or <unk> , or a <unk> , or a dry <unk> : you shall not offer them to the Lord , nor burn any thing of them upon the Lord ’ s altar .
An ox or a sheep , that hath the ear and the tail cut off , thou mayst offer <unk> : but a vow may not be paid with them .
22 : <unk> you shall not offer to the Lord any beast that hath the <unk> bruised , or <unk> , or cut and taken away : neither shall you do any such things in your land .
22 : <unk> you shall not offer bread to your God , from the hand of a stranger , nor any other thing that he would give : because they are all corrupted , and defiled .
You shall not receive them .
And the Lord spoke to Moses , saying :
When a bullock , or a sheep , or a goat , is brought forth , they shall be seven days under the <unk> of their <unk> : but the eighth day , and <unk> , they may be offered to the Lord .
Whether it be a cow , or a sheep , they shall not be sacrificed the same day with their young ones .
If you immolate a victim for thanksgiving to the Lord , that he may be <unk> ,
You shall eat it the same day .
There shall not any of it remain until the morning of the next day .
I am the Lord .
Keep my commandments , and do them .
I am the Lord .
<unk> not my holy name , that I may be sanctified in the midst of the children of Israel .
I am the Lord who sanctify you :
And who brought you out of the land of Egypt , that I might be your God .
I am the Lord .
Leviticus Chapter 23 Holy days to be kept .
And the Lord spoke to Moses , saying :
Speak to the children of Israel , and thou shalt say to them : These are the feasts of the Lord , which you shall call holy .
Six days shall ye do work : the seventh day , because it is the rest of the sabbath , shall be called holy .
You shall do no work on that day : it is the sabbath of the Lord in all your habitations .
These also are the holy days of the Lord , which you must celebrate in their <unk> .
The first month , the fourteenth day of the month at evening , is the phase of the Lord .
And the fifteenth day of the same month is the solemnity of the unleavened bread of the Lord .
Seven days shall you eat unleavened bread .
The first day shall be most solemn unto you , and holy : you shall do no servile work therein .
But you shall offer sacrifice in fire to the Lord seven days .
And the seventh day shall be more solemn , and more holy : and you shall do no servile work therein .
And the Lord spoke to Moses , saying :
Speak to the children of Israel , and thou shalt say to them : When you shall have entered into the land which I will give you , and shall reap your corn , you shall bring <unk> of ears , the firstfruits of your harvest to the priest .
23 : 11 . Who shall lift up the <unk> before the Lord , the next day after the sabbath , that it may be acceptable for you , and shall sanctify it .
And on the same day that the <unk> is consecrated , a lamb without blemish of the first year shall be killed for a holocaust of the Lord .
And the libations shall be offered with it : two tenths of flour tempered with oil , for a burnt offering of the Lord , and a most sweet odour .
<unk> also of wine , the fourth part of a hin .
You shall not eat either bread , or <unk> corn , or <unk> or the harvest , until the day that you shall offer thereof to your God .
It is a precept for ever throughout your generations , and all your dwellings .
You shall count therefore from the morrow after the sabbath , wherein you offered the <unk> of firstfruits , seven full weeks .
Even unto the morrow after the seventh week be expired , that is to say , fifty days : and so you shall offer a new sacrifice to the Lord .
Out of all your dwellings , two loaves of the firstfruits , of two tenths of flour leavened , which you shall <unk> for the firstfruits of the Lord .
And you shall offer with the loaves seven lambs without blemish of the first year , and one calf from the herd , and two rams , and they shall be for a holocaust with their libations for a most sweet odour to the Lord .
You shall offer also a buck goat for sin , and two lambs of the first year for sacrifices of peace offerings .
And when the priest hath lifted them up with the loaves of the firstfruits before the Lord , they shall fall to his use .
And you shall call this day most solemn , and most holy .
You shall do no servile work therein .
It shall be an everlasting ordinance in all your dwellings and generations .
And when you reap the corn of your land , you shall not cut it to the very ground : neither shall you gather the ears that remain .
But you shall leave them for the poor and for the strangers .
I am the Lord your God .
And the Lord spoke to Moses , saying :
Say to the children of Israel : The seventh month , on the first day of the month , you shall keep a sabbath , a memorial , with the sound of trumpets , and it shall be called holy .
You shall do no servile work therein , and you shall offer a holocaust to the Lord .
And the Lord spoke to Moses , saying :
Upon the tenth day of this seventh month shall be the day of atonement .
It shall be most solemn , and shall be called holy : and you shall afflict your souls on that day , and shall offer a holocaust to the Lord .
You shall do no servile work in the time of this day : because it is a day of <unk> , that the Lord your God may be merciful unto you .
Every soul that is not afflicted on this day , shall perish from among his people .
And every soul that shall do any work , the same will I destroy from among his people .
You shall do no work therefore on that day : it shall be an everlasting ordinance unto you in all your generations , and dwellings .
It is a sabbath of rest , and you shall afflict your souls beginning on the ninth day of the month .
From evening until evening you shall celebrate your sabbaths .
And the Lord spoke to Moses , saying :
Say to the children of Israel : From the fifteenth day of this same seventh month , shall be kept the feast of tabernacles , seven days to the Lord .
The first day shall be called most solemn and most holy : you shall do no servile work therein .
And seven days you shall offer holocausts to the Lord .
The eighth day also shall be most solemn and most holy : and you shall offer holocausts to the Lord .
For it is the day of assembly and congregation .
You shall do no servile work therein .
These are the feasts of the Lord which you shall call most solemn and most holy , and shall offer on them oblations to the Lord : holocausts and libations according to the rite of every day .
Besides the sabbaths of the Lord , and your gifts , and those things that you offer by vow , or which you shall give to the Lord <unk> .
So from the fifteenth day of the seventh month , when you shall have gathered in all the fruits of your land , you shall celebrate the feast of the Lord seven days .
On the first day and the eighth shall be a sabbath : that is a day of rest .
And you shall take to you on the first day the fruits of the <unk> tree , and branches of palm trees , and boughs of thick trees , and <unk> of the brook : And you shall rejoice before the Lord your God .
And you shall keep the solemnity thereof seven days in the year .
It shall be an everlasting ordinance in your generations .
In the seventh month shall you celebrate this feast .
And you shall dwell in <unk> seven days .
Every one that is of the race of Israel , shall dwell in tabernacles :
That your posterity may know , that I made the children of Israel to dwell in tabernacles , when I brought them out of the land of Egypt .
I am the Lord your God .
And Moses spoke concerning the feasts of the Lord to the children of Israel .
Leviticus Chapter 24 The oil for the lamps .
The loaves of proposition .
The punishment of blasphemy .
And the Lord spoke to Moses , saying :
Command the children of Israel , that they bring unto thee the finest and <unk> oil of <unk> , to furnish the lamps continually ,
Without the veil of the testimony in the tabernacle of the covenant .
And Aaron shall set them from evening until morning before the Lord , by a perpetual service and rite in your generations .
They shall be set upon the most pure candlestick before the Lord continually .
Thou shalt take also fine flour , and shalt <unk> twelve loaves thereof , two tenths shall be in every <unk> .
And thou shalt set them six and six , one against another , upon the most clean table before the Lord .
And thou shalt put upon them the <unk> frankincense , that the bread may be for a memorial of the oblation of the Lord .
Every sabbath they shall be changed before the Lord : being received of the children of Israel by an everlasting covenant .
And they shall be Aaron ’ s and his sons ’ , that they may eat them in the holy place : because it is most holy of the sacrifices of the Lord by a perpetual right .
And behold there went out the son of a woman of Israel , whom she had of an Egyptian , among the children of Israel : and fell at words in the camp with a man of Israel .
And when he had blasphemed the name , and had cursed it , he was brought to Moses .
( Now his mother was called <unk> , the daughter of <unk> , of the tribe of Dan . )
And they put him into prison , till they might know what the Lord would command .
And the Lord spoke to Moses ,
Saying : Bring forth the <unk> without the camp : and let them that heard him , put their hands upon his head : and let all the people stone him .
And thou shalt speak to the children of Israel : The man that curseth his God , shall bear his sin :
And he that <unk> the name of the Lord , dying let him die .
All the multitude shall stone him , whether he be a native or a stranger .
He that <unk> the name of the Lord , dying let him die .
He that striketh and killeth a man : dying let him die .
He that killeth a beast , shall make it good that is to say , shall give beast for beast .
He that giveth a blemish to any of his neighbours : as he hath done , so shall it be done to him :
<unk> for breach , eye for eye , tooth for tooth , shall he restore .
What blemish he gave , the like shall he be compelled to suffer .
He that striketh a beast , shall render another .
He that striketh a man shall be punished .
Let there be equal judgment among you , whether he be a stranger , or a native that <unk> : because I am the Lord your God .
And Moses spoke to the children of Israel .
And they brought forth him that had blasphemed , without the camp : and they stoned him .
And the children of Israel did as the Lord had commanded Moses .
Leviticus Chapter 25 The law of the seventh and of the <unk> year of jubilee .
And the Lord spoke to Moses in mount Sinai , saying :
Speak to the children of Israel , and thou shalt say to them : When you shall have entered into the land which I will give you , observe the rest of the sabbath of the Lord .
Six years thou shalt sow thy field and six years thou shalt <unk> thy vineyard , and shalt gather the fruits thereof .
But in the seventh year there shall be a sabbath to the land , of the resting of the Lord .
Thou shalt not sow thy field , nor <unk> thy vineyard .
What the ground shall bring forth of itself , thou shalt not reap : neither shalt thou gather the grapes or the firstfruits as a vintage .
For it is a year of rest to the land .
But they shall be unto you for meat , to thee and to thy manservant , to thy maidservant and thy hireling , and to the strangers that sojourn with thee .
All things that grow shall be meat to thy beasts and to thy cattle .
Thou shalt also number to thee seven weeks of years : that is to say , seven times seven , which together make <unk> years .
And thou shalt sound the trumpet in the seventh month , the tenth day of the month , in the time of the expiation in all your land .
And thou shalt sanctify the <unk> year , and shalt proclaim remission to all the inhabitants of thy land : for it is the year of jubilee .
Every man shall return to his possession , and every one shall go back to his former family : <unk> .... That is , a general release and <unk> from <unk> and bondage , and a <unk> of every man in his former possessions .
Because it is the jubilee and the <unk> year .
You shall not sow , nor reap the things that grow in the field of their own accord , neither shall you gather the firstfruits of the vines ,
Because of the sanctification of the jubilee .
But as they grow you shall presently eat them .
In the year of the jubilee all shall return to their possessions .
When thou shalt sell any thing to thy neighbour , or shalt buy of him : grieve not thy brother .
But thou shalt buy of him according to the number of years from the jubilee .
And he shall sell to thee according to the <unk> of the fruits .
The more years remain after the jubilee , the more shall the price increase : and the less time is counted , so much the less shall the purchase <unk> .
For he shall sell to thee the time of the fruits .
Do not afflict your countrymen : but let every one fear his God .
Because I am the Lord your God .
Do my precepts , and keep my judgments , and fulfil them : that you may dwell in the land without any fear .
And the ground may yield you its fruits , of which you may eat your fill , fearing no man ’ s <unk> .
But if you say : What shall we eat the seventh year , if we sow not , nor gather our fruits ?
I will give you my blessing the sixth year : and it shall yield the fruits of three years .
And the eighth year you shall sow , and shall eat of the old fruits , until the ninth year : till new grow up , you shall eat the old store .
The land also shall not be sold for ever : because it is mine , and you are strangers and <unk> with me .
For which cause all the country of your possession shall be under the condition of redemption .
If thy brother being <unk> sell his little possession , and his kinsman will : he may redeem what he had sold .
But if he have no kinsman , and he himself can find the price to redeem it :
The value of the fruits shall be counted from that time when he sold it .
And the <unk> he shall restore to the <unk> , and so shall receive his possession again .
But if his hands find not the means to repay the price , the <unk> shall have what he bought , until the year of the jubilee .
For in that year all that is sold shall return to the owner , and to the ancient <unk> .
He that <unk> a house within the walls of a city , shall have the liberty to redeem it , until one year be expired .
If he redeem it not , and the whole year be fully out , the <unk> shall possess it , and his posterity for ever , and it cannot be redeemed , not even in the jubilee .
But if the house be in a <unk> , that hath no walls , it shall be sold according to the same law as the fields .
If it be not redeemed before , in the jubilee it shall return to the owner .
The houses of Levites , which are in cities , may always be redeemed .
If they be not redeemed , in the jubilee they shall all return to the <unk> : because the houses of the cities of the Levites are for their possessions among the children of Israel .
But let not their suburbs be sold , because it is a perpetual possession .
If thy brother be <unk> , and weak of hand , and thou receive him as a stranger and sojourner , and he live with thee :
Take not usury of him nor more than thou gavest .
Fear thy God , that thy brother may live with thee .
Thou shalt not give him thy money upon usury : nor exact of him any increase of fruits .
I am the Lord your God , who brought you out of the land of Egypt , that I might give you the land of Chanaan , and might be your God .
If thy brother constrained by poverty , sell himself to thee : thou shalt not oppress him with the service of <unk> .
But he shall be as a hireling , and a sojourner : he shall work with thee until the year of the jubilee .
And afterwards he shall go out with his children : and shall return to his kindred and to the possession of his fathers .
For they are my servants , and I brought them out of the land of Egypt : let them not be sold as bondmen .
<unk> him not by might : but fear thy God .
Let your bondmen , and your <unk> , be of the nations that are round about you :
And of the strangers that sojourn among you , or that were born of them in your land .
These you shall have for servants :
And by right of inheritance shall leave them to your posterity , and shall possess them for ever .
But oppress not your brethren the children of Israel by might .
If the hand of a stranger or a sojourner grow strong among you , and thy brother being <unk> sell himself to him , or to any of his race :
After the <unk> he may be redeemed .
He that will of his brethren shall redeem him :
<unk> his uncle , or his uncle ’ s son , or his kinsman , by blood , or by <unk> .
But if he himself be able also , he shall redeem himself :
<unk> only the years from the time of his <unk> unto the year of the jubilee : and <unk> the money that he was sold for , according to the number of the years and the <unk> of a hired servant .
If there be many years that remain until the jubilee , according to them shall he also repay the price .
If few , he shall make the <unk> with him according to the number of the years : and shall repay to the <unk> of what remaineth of the years .
His wages being allowed for which he served before : he shall not afflict him violently in thy sight .
And if by these means he cannot be redeemed , in the year of the jubilee he shall go out with his children .
For the children of Israel are my servants , whom I brought forth out of the land of Egypt .
Leviticus Chapter 26 God ’ s promises to them that keep his commandments .
And the many punishments with which he <unk> transgressors .
I am the Lord your God .
You shall not make to yourselves any idol or graven thing : neither shall you <unk> pillars , nor set up a <unk> stone in your land , to adore it .
For I am the Lord your God .
Keep my sabbaths , and reverence my sanctuary .
I am the Lord .
If you walk in my precepts , and keep my commandments , and do them , I will give you rain in due <unk> .
And the ground shall bring forth its increase : and the trees shall be filled with fruit .
The <unk> of your harvest shall reach unto the vintage , and the vintage shall reach unto the <unk> time : and you shall eat your bread to the full , and dwell in your land without fear .
I will give peace in your coasts : you shall sleep , and there shall be none to make you afraid .
I will take away evil beasts : and the sword shall not pass through your quarters .
You shall pursue your enemies : and they shall fall before you .
<unk> of yours shall pursue a hundred others : and a hundred of you ten thousand .
Your enemies shall fall before you by the sword .
I will look on you , and make you increase : you shall be multiplied , and I will establish my covenant with you .
You shall eat the <unk> of the old store : and , new coming on , you shall cast away the old .
I will set my tabernacle in the midst of you : and my soul shall not cast you off .
I will walk among you , and will be your God : and you shall be my people .
I am the Lord your God : who have brought you out of the land of the Egyptians , that you should not serve them : and who have broken the chains of your necks , that you might go upright .
But if you will not hear me , nor do all my commandments :
If you despise my laws , and <unk> my judgments so as not to do those things which are appointed by me , and to make void my covenant :
I also will do these things to you .
I will quickly visit you with poverty , and burning heat , which shall waste your eyes , and consume your lives .
You shall sow your seed in vain , which shall be devoured by your enemies .
I will set my face against you , and you shall fall down before your enemies : and shall be made subject to them that hate you .
You shall flee when no man <unk> you .
But if you will not yet for all this obey me : I will chastise you seven times more for your sins .
And I will break the pride of your <unk> : and I will make to you the heaven above as iron , and the earth as brass .
Your labour shall be spent in vain : the ground shall not bring forth her increase : nor the trees yield their fruit .
If you walk contrary to me , and will not hearken to me , I will bring seven times more plagues upon you for your sins .
And I will send in upon you the beasts of the field , to destroy you and your cattle , and make you few in number : and that your <unk> may be desolate .
And if even so you will not <unk> , but will walk contrary to me :
I also will walk contrary to you , and will strike you seven times for your sins .
And I will bring in upon you the sword that shall <unk> my covenant .
And when you shall flee into the cities , I will send the pestilence in the midst of you .
And you shall be delivered into the hands of your enemies ,
After I shall have broken the staff of your bread : so that ten women shall <unk> your bread in one oven , and give it out by weight : and you shall eat , and shall not be filled ,
But if you will not for all this hearken to me , but will walk against me ,
I will also go against you with <unk> fury : and I will chastise you with seven plagues for your sins ,
So that you shall eat the flesh of your sons and of your daughters .
I will destroy your high places , and break your idols .
You shall fall among the ruins of your idols , and my soul shall abhor you .
<unk> that I will bring your cities to be a wilderness : and I will make your <unk> desolate : and will receive no more your sweet <unk> .
And I will destroy your land : and your enemies shall be astonished at it , when they shall be the inhabitants thereof .
And I will scatter you among the Gentiles : and I will draw out the sword after you .
And your land shall be desert , and your cities destroyed .
Then shall the land enjoy her sabbaths all the days of her desolation .
When you shall be
In the enemy ’ s land , she shall keep a sabbath , and rest in the sabbaths of her desolation : because she did not rest in your sabbaths , when you dwelt therein .
And as to them that shall remain of you I will send fear in their hearts in the countries of their enemies .
The sound of a flying leaf shall terrify them : and they shall flee as it were from the sword .
They shall fall , when no man <unk> them .
And they shall every one fall upon their brethren as fleeing from wars : none of you shall dare to resist your enemies .
You shall perish among the Gentiles : and an enemy ’ s land shall consume you .
And if of them also some remain , they shall pine away in their iniquities , in the land of their enemies : and they shall be afflicted for the sins of their fathers , and their own .
Until they confess their iniquities , and the iniquities of their <unk> , whereby they have transgressed against me , and walked contrary unto me .
Therefore I also will walk against them , and bring them into their enemies ’ land until their uncircumcised mind be ashamed .
Then shall they pray for their sins .
And I will remember my covenant , that I made with Jacob , and Isaac , and Abraham .
I will remember also the land :
Which when she shall be left by them , shall enjoy her sabbaths , being desolate for them .
But they shall pray for their sins , because they rejected my judgments , and despised my laws .
And yet for all that when they were in the land of their enemies , I did not cast them off altogether .
Neither did I so despise them that they should be quite consumed : and I should make void my covenant with them .
For I am the Lord their God .
And I will remember my former covenant , when I brought them out of the land of Egypt , in the sight of the Gentiles , to be their God .
I am the Lord .
These are the judgments , and precepts , and laws , which the Lord gave between him and the children of Israel , in mount Sinai , by the hand of Moses .
Leviticus Chapter 27 Of vows and tithes .
And the Lord spoke to Moses , saying :
Speak to the children of Israel , and thou shalt say to them : The man that shall have made a vow , and promised his soul to God , shall give the price according to estimation .
If it be a man from twenty years old unto sixty years old , he shall give fifty sicles of silver , after the weight of the sanctuary :
If a woman , thirty .
But from the fifth year until the twentieth , a man shall give twenty sicles : a woman ten .
From one month until the fifth year , for a male shall be given five sicles : for a female three .
A man that is sixty years old or upward , shall give fifteen sicles : a woman ten .
If he be poor , and not able to pay the estimation , he shall stand before the priest : and as much as he shall value him at , and see him able to pay , so much shall he give .
But a beast that may be sacrificed to the Lord , if any one shall vow , shall be holy ,
And cannot be changed : that is to say , neither a better for a worse , nor a worse for a better .
And if he shall change it : both that which was changed , and that for which it was changed , shall be consecrated to the Lord .
An unclean beast , which cannot be sacrificed to the Lord , if any man shall vow , shall be brought before the priest : 27 : 12 . Who judging whether it be good or bad , shall set the price .
Which , if he that offereth it will give , he shall add above the estimation the fifth part .
If a man shall vow his house , and sanctify it to the Lord , the priest shall consider it , whether it be good or bad : and it shall be sold according to the price , which he shall appoint .
But if he that vowed , will redeem it , he shall give the fifth part of the estimation over and above : and shall have the house .
And if he vow the field of his possession , and consecrate it to the Lord , the price shall be <unk> according to the measure of the seed .
If the ground be sown with thirty <unk> of barley , let it be sold for fifty sicles of silver .
If he vow his field immediately from the year of jubilee that is beginning : as much as it may be worth , at so much it shall be <unk> .
But if some time after , the priest shall <unk> the money according to the number of years that remain until the jubilee , and the price shall be <unk> .
And if he that had vowed , will redeem his field , he shall add the fifth part of the money of the estimation , and shall possess it .
And if he will not redeem it , but it be sold to any other man , he that vowed it , may not redeem it any more .
For when the day of jubilee cometh , it shall be sanctified to the Lord , and as a possession consecrated , <unk> to the right of the priest .
If a field that was bought , and not of a man ’ s <unk> ’ possession , be sanctified to the Lord :
The priest shall <unk> the price according to the number of years , unto the jubilee .
And he that had vowed , shall give that to the Lord .
But in the jubilee , it shall return to the former owner , who had sold it , and had it in the lot of his possession .
All estimation shall be made according to the sicle of the sanctuary .
A sicle hath twenty <unk> .
The firstborn , which belong to the Lord , no man may sanctify and vow : whether it be bullock , or sheep , they are the Lord ’ s .
And if it be an unclean beast , he that offereth it shall redeem it , according to thy estimation , and shall add the fifth part of the price .
If he will not redeem it , it shall be sold to another for how much soever it was <unk> by thee .
<unk> thing that is <unk> to the Lord , whether it be man , or beast , or field , shall not be sold : neither may it be redeemed .
Whatsoever is once consecrated shall be holy of holies to the Lord .
And any consecration that is offered by man , shall not be redeemed , but dying shall die .
All tithes of the land , whether of corn , or of the fruits of trees , are the Lord ’ s , and are sanctified to him .
And if any man will redeem his tithes , he shall add the fifth part of them .
Of all the tithes of oxen , and sheep , and goats , that pass under the shepherd ’ s rod , every tenth that cometh shall be sanctified to the Lord .
It shall not be chosen neither good nor bad , neither shall it be changed for another .
If any man change it : both that which was changed , and that for which it was changed , shall be sanctified to the Lord , and shall not be redeemed .
These are the precepts which the Lord commanded Moses for the children of Israel in mount Sinai .
THE BOOK OF <unk> This fourth Book of Moses is called <unk> , because it <unk> with the <unk> of the people .

As the Lord had commanded Moses .
And they were numbered in the desert of Sinai .

But appoint them over the tabernacle of the testimony , and all the vessels thereof , and whatsoever <unk> to the ceremonies .
They shall carry the tabernacle and all the furniture thereof : and they shall minister , and shall <unk> round about the tabernacle .
When you are to go forward , the Levites shall take down the tabernacle : when you are to camp , they shall set it up .
What stranger soever cometh to it , shall be slain .
And the children of Israel shall camp every man by his troops and bands and army .
But the Levites shall pitch their tents round about the tabernacle , lest there come indignation upon the multitude of the children of Israel , and they shall keep watch , and guard the tabernacle of the testimony .
And the children of Israel did according to all things which the Lord had commanded Moses .

And these the names of the sons of Aaron : his firstborn Nadab , then Abiu , and Eleazar , and Ithamar .
These the names of the sons of Aaron the priests that were anointed , and whose hands were filled and consecrated , to do the functions of priesthood .
Now Nadab and Abiu died , without children , when they offered strange fire before the Lord , in the desert of Sinai : and Eleazar and Ithamar performed the priestly office in the presence of Aaron their father .
And the Lord spoke to Moses , saying :
Bring the tribe of Levi , and make them stand in the sight of Aaron the priest to minister to him , and let them watch ,
And observe whatsoever <unk> to the service of the multitude before the tabernacle of the testimony ,
And let them keep the vessels of the tabernacle , serving in the ministry thereof .

But thou shalt appoint Aaron and his sons over the service of priesthood .
The stranger that <unk> to minister , shall be put to death .
And the Lord spoke to Moses , saying :
I have taken the Levites from the children of Israel , for every firstborn that openeth the womb among the children of Israel , and the Levites shall be mine .
For every firstborn is mine : since I struck the firstborn in the land of Egypt : I have sanctified to myself whatsoever is firstborn in Israel both of man and beast , they are mine : I am the Lord .
And the Lord spoke to Moses in the desert of Sinai , saying :

Under their prince <unk> the son of <unk> .
And their charge shall be in the tabernacle of the covenant :

Before the tabernacle of the covenant , that is to say on the east side shall Moses and Aaron camp , with their sons , having the <unk> of the sanctuary , in the midst of the children of Israel .
What stranger soever cometh unto it , shall be put to death .
All the Levites , that I Moses and Aaron numbered according to the precept of the Lord , by their <unk> families , of the male kind from one month and upward , were twenty-two thousand .
And the Lord said to Moses : <unk> the firstborn of the male sex of the children of Israel , from one month and upward , and thou shalt take the sum of them .
And thou shalt take the Levites to me for all the firstborn of the children of Israel , I am the Lord : and their cattle for all the firstborn of the cattle of the children of Israel :
Moses reckoned up , as the Lord had commanded , the firstborn of the children of Israel :
And the males by their names , from one month and upward , were twenty-two thousand two hundred and <unk> .

Thou shalt take five sicles for every head , according to the weight of the sanctuary .
A sicle hath twenty <unk> .
And thou shalt give the money to Aaron and his sons , the price of them that are above .
Moses therefore took the money of them that were above , and whom they had redeemed from the Levites ,
For the firstborn of the children of Israel , one thousand three hundred and <unk> sicles , according to the weight of the sanctuary ,
And gave it to Aaron and his sons according to the word that the Lord had commanded him .

This is the service of the sons of Caath :
When the camp is ; to set forward , Aaron and his sons shall go into the tabernacle of the covenant , and the holy of holies , and shall take down the veil that hangeth before the door , and shall <unk> up the ark of the testimony in it ,
And shall cover it again with a cover of violet skins , and shall spread over it a cloth all of violet , and shall put in the bars .

And over them shall be Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest , to whose charge <unk> the oil to dress the lamps , and the sweet incense , and the sacrifice , that is always offered , and the oil of unction , and whatsoever <unk> to the service of the tabernacle , and of all the vessels that are in the sanctuary .
And the Lord spoke to Moses and Aaron , saying :
Destroy not the people of Caath from the midst of the Levites :
But do this to them , that they may live , and not die , by touching the holies of holies .
Aaron and his sons shall go in , and they shall appoint every man his work , and shall divide the burdens that every man is to carry .
Let not others by any <unk> see the things that are in the sanctuary before they be wrapped up , otherwise they shall die .

Thou shalt <unk> up the sons of Merari also by the families and houses of their fathers ,
From thirty years old and upward , unto fifty years old , all that go in to the office of their ministry , and to the service of the covenant of the testimony .
These are their burdens : They shall carry the boards of the tabernacle and the bars thereof , the pillars and their sockets ,
The pillars also of the court round about , with their sockets and <unk> and cords .
They shall receive by account all the vessels and furniture , and so shall carry them .
This is the office of the family of the <unk> , and their ministry in the tabernacle of the covenant : and they shall be under the hand of Ithamar the son of Aaron the priest .

All that were reckoned up of the Levites , and whom Moses and Aaron and the princes of Israel took by name , by the kindreds and houses of their fathers ,
From thirty years old and upward , until fifty years old , that go into the ministry of the tabernacle , and to carry the burdens ,
Were in all eight thousand five hundred and eighty .
Moses reckoned them up according to the word of the Lord , every one according to their office and burdens , as the Lord had commanded him .
