And the Lord spoke to Moses , saying :
Command the children of Israel , that they cast out of the camp every leper , and whosoever hath an issue of seed , or is defiled by the dead :
Whether it be man or woman , cast ye them out of the camp , lest they defile it when I shall dwell with you ,
And the children of Israel did so , and they cast them forth without the camp , as the Lord had spoken to Moses .
And the Lord spoke to Moses , saying :
Say to the children of Israel : When a man or woman shall have committed any of all the sins that men are wont to commit , and by <unk> shall have transgressed the commandment of the Lord , and offended ,
They shall confess their sin , and restore the principal itself , and the fifth part over and above , to him against whom they have sinned .
Shall confess ....
This confession and <unk> , ordained in the Old <unk> , was a figure of the sacrament of penance .
But if there be no one to receive it , they shall give it to the Lord , and it shall be the priest ’ s , besides the ram that is offered for expiation , to be an <unk> sacrifice .
All the firstfruits also , which the children of Israel offer , belong to the priest :
And whatsoever is offered into the sanctuary by every one , and is delivered into the hands of the priest , it shall be his .
And the Lord spoke to Moses , saying :
Speak to the children of Israel , and thou shalt say to them : The man whose wife shall have gone astray , and <unk> her husband ,
Shall have slept with another man , and her husband cannot discover it , but the adultery is secret , and cannot be proved by witnesses , because she was not found in the adultery :
If the spirit of jealousy stir up the husband against his wife , who either is defiled , or is charged with false <unk> , The spirit of jealousy , etc ....
This ordinance was designed to clear the innocent , and to prevent jealous husbands from doing mischief to their wives : as likewise to give all a horror of adultery , by punishing it in so <unk> a manner .
He shall bring her to the priest , and shall offer an oblation for her , the tenth part of a measure of barley meal : he shall not pour oil thereon , nor put frankincense upon it : because it is a sacrifice of jealousy , and an oblation <unk> out adultery .
The priest therefore shall offer it , and set it before the Lord .
And he shall take holy water in an earthen vessel , and he shall cast a little earth of the pavement of the tabernacle into it .
And when the woman shall stand before the Lord , he shall uncover her head , and shall put on her hands the sacrifice of remembrance , and the oblation of jealousy : and he himself shall hold the most bitter waters , <unk> he hath <unk> curses with <unk> .
And he shall <unk> her , and shall say : If another man hath not slept with thee , and if thou be not defiled by <unk> thy husband ’ s bed , these most bitter waters , on which I have <unk> curses , shall not hurt thee .
But if thou hast gone aside from thy husband , and art defiled , and hast <unk> with another man :
These curses shall light upon thee : The Lord make thee a curse , and an example for all among his people : may he make thy thigh to <unk> , and may thy belly <unk> and burst asunder .
Let the cursed waters enter into thy belly , and may thy womb <unk> and thy thigh <unk> .
And the woman shall answer , Amen , amen .
And the priest shall write these curses in a book , and shall wash them out with the most bitter waters , upon which he hath <unk> the curses ,
And he shall give them her to drink .
And when she hath drunk them up ,
The priest shall take from her hand the sacrifice of jealousy , and shall <unk> it before the Lord , and shall put it upon the altar : yet so as first ,
To take a <unk> of the sacrifice of that which is offered , and burn it upon the altar : and so give the most bitter waters to the woman to drink .
And when she hath drunk them , if she be defiled , and having despised her husband be guilty of adultery , the <unk> shall go through her , and her belly swelling , her thigh shall <unk> : and the woman shall be a curse , and an example to all the people .
But if she be not defiled , she shall not be hurt , and shall bear children .
This is the law of jealousy .
If a woman hath gone aside from her husband , and be defiled ,
And the husband stirred up by the spirit of jealousy bring her before the Lord , and the priest do to her according to all things that are here written :
The husband shall be blameless , and she shall bear her iniquity .
Numbers Chapter 6 The law of the <unk> : the form of blessing the people .
And the Lord spoke to Moses , saying :
Speak to the children of Israel , and thou shalt say to them : When a man , or woman , shall make a vow to be sanctified , and will consecrate themselves to the Lord :
They shall abstain from wine , and from every thing that may make a man drunk .
They shall not drink vinegar of wine , or of any other drink , nor any thing that is pressed out of the grape : nor shall they eat grapes either <unk> or dried .
All the days that they are consecrated to the Lord by vow : they shall eat nothing that cometh of the vineyard , from the <unk> even to the <unk> .
All the time of his separation no <unk> shall pass over his head , until the day be fulfilled of his consecration to the Lord .
He shall be holy , and shall let the hair of his head grow .
All the time of his consecration he shall not go in to any dead ,
Neither shall he make himself unclean , even for his father , or for his mother , or for his brother , or for his sister , when they die , because the consecration of his God is upon his head .
All the days of his separation he shall be holy to the Lord .
But if any man die suddenly before him : the head of his consecration shall be defiled : and he shall shave it forthwith on the same day of his purification , and again on the seventh day .
And on the eighth day he shall bring two <unk> , or two young pigeons to the priest in the entry of the covenant of the testimony .
And the priest shall offer one for sin , and the other for a holocaust , and shall pray for him , for that he hath sinned by the dead : and he shall sanctify his head that day :
And shall consecrate to the Lord the days of his separation , offering a lamb of one year for sin : yet so that the former days be made void , because his sanctification was profaned .
This is the law of consecration .
When the days which he had determined by vow shall be expired , he shall bring him to the door of the tabernacle of the covenant ,
And shall offer his oblation to the Lord : one he lamb of a year old without blemish for a holocaust , and one <unk> lamb of a year old without blemish for a sin offering , and one ram without blemish for a victim of peace offering ,
A basket also of unleavened bread , tempered with oil , and <unk> without leaven anointed with oil , and the libations of each :
And the priest shall present them before the Lord , and shall offer both the sin offering and the holocaust .
But the ram he shall immolate for a sacrifice of peace offering to the Lord , offering at the same time the basket of unleavened bread , and the libations that are due by custom .
Then shall the hair of the consecration of the Nazarite , be <unk> off before the door of the tabernacle of the covenant : and he shall take his hair , and lay it upon the fire , which is under the sacrifice of the peace offerings .
And shall take the boiled shoulder of the ram , and one unleavened <unk> out of the basket , and one unleavened <unk> , and he shall deliver them into the hands of the Nazarite , after his head is <unk> .
And receiving them again from him , he shall <unk> them in the sight of the Lord : and they being sanctified shall belong to the priest , as the breast , which was commanded to be separated , and the shoulder .
After this the Nazarite may drink wine .
This is the law of the Nazarite , when he hath vowed his oblation to the Lord in the time of his consecration , besides those things which his hand shall find , according to that which he had vowed in his mind , so shall he do for the <unk> of his sanctification .
And the Lord spoke to Moses , saying :
Say to Aaron and his sons : Thus shall you bless the children of Israel , and you shall say to them :
The Lord bless thee , and keep thee .
The Lord shew his face to thee , and have mercy on thee .
The Lord turn his countenance to thee , and give thee peace .
And they shall <unk> my name upon the children of Israel , and I will bless them .

And when Moses entered into the tabernacle of the covenant , to consult the oracle , he heard the voice of one speaking to him from the propitiatory , that is over the ark between the two cherubims , and from this place he spoke to him .
Numbers Chapter 8 The seven lamps are placed on the golden candlestick , to shine towards the loaves of proposition : the <unk> of the Levites : and to what age they shall serve in the tabernacle .
And the Lord spoke to Moses , saying :
Speak to Aaron , and thou shalt say to him : When thou shalt place the seven lamps , let the candlestick be set up on the south side .
Give orders therefore that the lamps look over against the north , towards the table of the loaves of proposition , over against that part shall they give light , towards which the candlestick looketh .
And Aaron did so , and he put the lamps upon the candlestick , as the Lord had commanded Moses .
Now this was the work of the candlestick , it was of beaten gold , both the <unk> in the middle , and all that came out of both sides of the branches : according to the pattern which the Lord had shewn to Moses , so he made the candlestick .
And the Lord spoke to Moses , saying :
Take the Levites out of the midst of the children of Israel , and thou shalt purify them ,
According to this rite : Let them be sprinkled with the water of purification , and let them shave all the hairs of their flesh .
And when they shall have washed their garments , and are cleansed , Let them be sprinkled with the water of purification ....
This was the holy water mixed with the ashes of the red cow , Num .
19 . , appointed for <unk> all that were unclean .
It was a figure of the blood of Christ , applied to our souls by his holy sacraments .
They shall take an ox of the herd , and for the offering thereof fine flour tempered with oil : and thou shalt take another ox of the herd for a sin offering :
And thou shalt bring the Levites before the tabernacle of the covenant , calling together all the multitude of the children of Israel :
And when the Levites are before the Lord , the children of Israel shall put their hands upon them :
And Aaron shall offer the Levites , as a gift in the sight of the Lord from the children of Israel , that they may serve in his ministry .
The Levites also shall put their hands upon the heads of the oxen , of which thou shalt sacrifice one for sin , and the other for a holocaust to the Lord , to pray for them .
And thou shalt set the Levites in the sight of Aaron and of his , and shalt consecrate them being offered to the Lord ,
And shalt separate them from the midst of the children of Israel , to be mine .
And afterwards they shall enter into the tabernacle of the covenant , to serve me .
And thus shalt thou purify and consecrate them for an oblation of the Lord : for as a gift they were given me by the children of Israel .
I have taken them instead of the firstborn that open every womb in Israel ,
For all the firstborn of the children of Israel , both of men and of beasts , are mine .
From the day that I slew every firstborn in the land of Egypt , have I sanctified them to myself :
And I have taken the Levites for all the firstborn of the children of Israel :
And have delivered them for a gift to Aaron and his sons out of the midst of the people , to serve me for Israel in the tabernacle of the covenant , and to pray for them , lest there should be a plague among the people , if they should <unk> to approach unto my sanctuary .
And Moses and Aaron and all the multitude of the children of Israel did with the Levites all that the Lord had commanded Moses :
And they were purified , and washed their garments .
And Aaron lifted them up in the sight of the Lord , and prayed for them ,
That being purified they might go into the tabernacle of the covenant to do their <unk> before Aaron and his sons .
As the Lord had commanded Moses touching the Levites , so was it done .
And the Lord spoke to Moses , saying :
This is the law of the Levites : From <unk> years old and <unk> , they shall go in to minister in the tabernacle of the covenant .
And when they shall have accomplished the <unk> year of their age , they shall cease to serve :
And they shall be the ministers of their brethren in the tabernacle of the covenant , to keep the things that are committed to their care , but not to do the works .
Thus shalt thou order the Levites touching their charge .
Numbers Chapter 9 The precept of the pasch is renewed : the unclean and <unk> are to observe it the second month : the camp is <unk> by the pillar of the cloud .
The Lord spoke to Moses in the desert of Sinai , the second year after they were come out of the land of Egypt , in the first month , saying :
Let the children of Israel make the phase in its due time , Make the phase .... That is , keep the paschal solemnity , and eat the paschal lamb .
The fourteenth day of this month in the evening , according to all the ceremonies and justifications thereof .
And Moses commanded the children of Israel that they should make the phase .
And they made it in its proper time : the fourteenth day of the month at evening , in mount Sinai .
The children of Israel did according to all things that the Lord had commanded Moses .
But behold some who were unclean by occasion of the soul of a man , who could not make the phase on that day , coming to Moses and Aaron , Behold some who were unclean by occasion of the soul of a man , etc .... That is , by having touched or come near a dead body , out of which the soul was departed .
Said to them : We are unclean by occasion of the soul of a man .
Why are we kept back that we may not offer in its season the offering to the Lord among the children of Israel ?
And Moses answered them : Stay that I may consult the Lord what he will <unk> concerning you .
And the Lord spoke to Moses , saying :
Say to the children of Israel : The man that shall be unclean by occasion of one that is dead , or shall be in a journey afar off in your nation , let him make the phase to the Lord .
In the second month , on the fourteenth day of the month in the evening , they shall eat it with unleavened bread and wild <unk> :
They shall not leave any thing thereof until morning , nor break a bone thereof , they shall observe all the ceremonies of the phase .
But if any man is clean , and was not on a journey , and did not make the phase , that soul shall be cut off from among his people , because he offered not sacrifice to the Lord in due season : he shall bear his sin .
The sojourner also and the stranger if they be among you , shall make the phase to the Lord according to the ceremonies and justifications thereof .
The same ordinances shall be with you both for the stranger , and for him that was born in the land .
Now on the day that the tabernacle was <unk> up , a cloud covered it .
But from the evening there was over the tabernacle , as it were , the appearance of fire until the morning .
So it was always : by day the cloud covered it , and by night as it were the appearance of fire .
And when the cloud that covered the tabernacle was taken up , then the children of Israel marched forward : and in the place where the cloud stood still , there they camped .
At the commandment of the Lord they marched , and at his commandment they pitched the tabernacle .
All the days that the cloud abode over the tabernacle , they remained in the same place :
And if it was so that it continued over it a long time , the children of Israel kept the watches of the Lord , and marched not ,
For as many days soever as the cloud stayed over the tabernacle .
At the commandment of the Lord they pitched their tents , and at his commandment they took them down .
If the cloud tarried from evening until morning , and immediately at break of day left the tabernacle , they marched forward : and if it departed after a day and a night , they took down their tents .
But if it remained over the tabernacle for two days or a month or a longer time , the children of Israel remained in the same place , and marched not : but immediately as soon as it departed , they removed the camp .
By the word of the Lord they pitched their tents , and by his word they marched : and kept the watches of the Lord according to his commandment by the hand of Moses .
Numbers Chapter 10 The silver trumpets and their use .
They march from Sinai .
And the Lord spoke to Moses , saying :
Make thee two trumpets of beaten silver , wherewith thou mayest call together the multitude when the camp is to be removed .
And when thou shalt sound the trumpets , all the multitude shall gather unto thee to the door of the tabernacle of the covenant .
If thou sound but once , the princes and the heads of the multitude of Israel shall come to thee .
But if the sound of the trumpets be longer , and with <unk> , they that are on the east side , shall first go forward .
And at the second sounding and like noise of the trumpet , they who lie on the south side shall take up their tents .
And after this manner shall the rest do , when the trumpets shall sound for a march .
But when the people is to be gathered together , the sound of the trumpets shall be plain , and they shall not make a broken sound .
And the sons of Aaron the priest shall sound the trumpets : and this shall be an ordinance for ever in your generations .
If you go forth to war out of your land against the enemies that fight against you , you shall sound <unk> with the trumpets , and there shall be a remembrance of you before the Lord your God , that you may be delivered out of the hands of your enemies .
If at any time you shall have a banquet , and on your festival days , and on the first days of your months , you shall sound the trumpets over the holocausts , and the sacrifices of peace offerings , that they may be to you for a remembrance of your God .
I am the Lord your God .
The second year , in the second month , the twentieth day of the month , the cloud was taken up from the tabernacle of the covenant .
And the children of Israel marched by their troops from the desert of Sinai , and the cloud rested in the wilderness of Pharan .
And the first went forward according to the commandment of the Lord by the hand of Moses .
The sons of Juda by their troops : whose prince was <unk> the son of Aminadab .
In the tribe of the sons of Issachar , the prince was Nathanael the son of <unk> .
In the tribe of Zabulon , the prince was Eliab the son of <unk> .
And the tabernacle was taken down , and the sons of Gerson and Merari set forward , bearing it .
And the sons of Ruben also marched , by their troops and <unk> , whose prince was <unk> the son of <unk> .
And in the tribe of Simeon , the prince was <unk> the son of <unk> .
And in the tribe of Gad , the prince was <unk> the son of <unk> .
Then the <unk> also marched carrying the sanctuary .
So long was the tabernacle carried , till they came to the place of setting it up .
The sons of Ephraim also moved their camp by their troops , in whose army the prince was Elisama the son of Ammiud .
And in the tribe of the sons of Manasses , the prince was <unk> the son of <unk> .
And in the tribe of Benjamin , the prince was <unk> the son of Gedeon .
The last of all the camp marched the sons of Dan by their troops , in whose army the prince was <unk> the son of <unk> .
And in the tribe of the sons of Aser , the prince was <unk> the son of <unk> .
And in the tribe of the sons of Nephtali , the prince was <unk> the son of Enan .
This was the order of the <unk> , and <unk> of the children of Israel by their troops , when they set forward .
And Moses said to <unk> the son of Raguel the <unk> , his kinsman : We are going towards the place which the Lord will give us : come with us , that we may do thee good : for the Lord hath promised good things to Israel .
But he answered him : I will not go with thee , but I will return to my country , wherein I was born .
And he said : Do not leave us : for thou knowest in what places we should <unk> in the wilderness , and thou shalt be our guide .
And if thou comest with us , we will give thee what is the best of the riches which the Lord shall deliver to us .
So they marched from the mount of the Lord three days ’ journey , and the ark of the covenant of the Lord went before them , for three days <unk> a place for the camp .
The cloud also of the Lord was over them by day when they marched .
And when the ark was lifted up , Moses said : Arise , O Lord , and let thy enemies be scattered , and let them that hate thee , flee from before thy face .
And when it was set down , he said : Return , O Lord , to the multitude of the host of Israel .
Numbers Chapter 11 The people murmur and are punished with fire .
God <unk> seventy ancients for <unk> to Moses .
They prophesy .
The people have their fill of flesh , but forthwith many die of the plague .
In the mean time there arose a murmuring of the people against the Lord , as it were <unk> at their <unk> .
And when the Lord heard it he was angry .
And the fire of the Lord being kindled against them , devoured them that were at the uttermost part of the camp .
And when the people cried to Moses , Moses prayed to the Lord , and the fire was swallowed up .
And he called the name of that place , The burning : for that the fire of the Lord had been kindled against them .
The burning .... Hebrew , <unk> .
For a <unk> multitude of people , that came up with them , burned with desire , sitting and weeping , the children of Israel also being joined with them , and said : Who shall give us flesh to eat ?
A <unk> multitude ....
These were people that came with them out of Egypt , who were not of the race of Israel ; who , by their murmuring , drew also the children of Israel to murmur : this should teach us the danger of <unk> ourselves with the children of Egypt , that is , with the lovers and <unk> of this wicked world .
We remember the fish that we ate in Egypt free <unk> : the <unk> come into our mind , and the <unk> , and the <unk> , and the <unk> , and the <unk> .
Our soul is dry , our eyes behold nothing else but manna .
Now the manna was like <unk> seed , of the colour of <unk> .
<unk> .... <unk> , according to <unk> , <unk> , c . <unk> was of the colour of a man ’ s nail , white and bright .
And the people went about , and gathering it , ground it in a <unk> , or beat it in a mortar , and boiled it in a pot , and made <unk> thereof of the taste of bread tempered with oil .
And when the dew fell in the night upon the camp , the manna also fell with it .
Now Moses heard the people weeping by their families , every one at the door of his tent .
And the wrath of the Lord was exceedingly enkindled : to Moses also the thing seemed <unk> .
And he said to the Lord : Why hast thou afflicted thy servant ?
Wherefore do I not find favour before thee ?
And why hast thou laid the weight of all this people upon me ?
Have I conceived all this multitude , or begotten them , that thou shouldst say to me : <unk> them in thy bosom as the nurse is wont to carry the little infant , and bear them into the land , for which thou hast sworn to their fathers ?
Whence should I have flesh to give to so great a multitude ?
They weep against me , saying : Give us flesh that we may eat .
I am not able alone to bear all this people , because it is too heavy for me .
But if it seem unto thee otherwise , I beseech thee to kill me , and let me find grace in thy eyes , that I be not afflicted with so great evils .
And the Lord said to Moses : Gather unto me seventy men of the ancients of Israel , whom thou knowest to be ancients and masters of the people : and thou shalt bring them to the door of the tabernacle of the covenant , and shalt make them stand there with thee , <unk> men ....
This was the first <unk> of the council or <unk> , called the <unk> , <unk> of seventy or seventy-two <unk> or counsellors .
That I may come down and speak with thee : and I will take of thy spirit , and will give to them , that they may bear with thee the burden of the people , and thou mayest not be <unk> alone .
And thou shalt say to the people : Be ye sanctified : to morrow you shall eat flesh : for I have heard you say : Who will give us flesh to eat ?
It was well with us in Egypt .
That the Lord may give you flesh , and you may eat :
Not for one day , nor two , nor five , nor ten , no nor for twenty .
But even for a month of days , till it come out at your <unk> , and become <unk> to you , because you have cast off the Lord , who is in the midst of you , and have wept before him , saying : Why came we out of Egypt ?
And Moses said : There are six hundred thousand footmen of this people , and sayest thou : I will give them flesh to eat a whole month ?
Shall then a multitude of sheep and oxen be killed , that it may <unk> for their food ?
or shall the fishes of the sea be gathered together to fill them ?
And the Lord answered him : Is the hand of the Lord <unk> ?
Thou shalt presently see whether my word shall come to pass or no .
Moses therefore came , and told the people the words of the Lord , and assembled seventy men of the ancients of Israel , and made them to stand about the tabernacle .
And the Lord came down in a cloud , and spoke to him , taking away of the spirit that was in Moses , and giving to the seventy men .
And when the spirit had rested on them they prophesied , nor did they cease afterwards .
Now there remained in the camp two of the men , of whom one was called <unk> , and the other <unk> , upon whom the spirit rested ; for they also had been <unk> , but were not gone forth to the tabernacle .
And when they prophesied in the camp , there ran a young man , and told Moses , saying : <unk> and <unk> prophesy in the camp .
<unk> Josue the son of Nun , the minister of Moses , and chosen out of many , said : My lord Moses forbid them .
But he said : Why hast thou <unk> for me ?
O that all the people might prophesy , and that the Lord would give them his spirit !
And Moses returned , with the ancients of Israel , into the camp .
And a wind going out from the Lord , taking <unk> up beyond the sea brought them , and cast them into the camp for the space of one day ’ s journey , on every side of the camp round about , and they <unk> in the air two cubits high above the ground .
The people therefore rising up all that day , and night , and the next day , gathered together of <unk> , he that did least , ten <unk> : and they dried them round about the camp .
As yet the flesh was between their teeth , neither had that kind of meat failed : when behold the wrath of the Lord being provoked against the people , struck them with an exceeding great plague .
And that place was called , The graves of lust : for there they buried the people that had <unk> .
And departing from the graves of lust , they came unto <unk> , and abode there .
The graves of lust .... Or , the sepulchres of concupiscence : so called from their <unk> desire of flesh .
In Hebrew , <unk> .
<unk> .
Numbers Chapter 12 Mary and Aaron murmur against Moses , whom God praiseth above other prophets .
Mary being struck with leprosy , Aaron <unk> his fault .
Moses prayeth for her , and after seven days ’ separation from the camp , she is restored .
And Mary and Aaron spoke against Moses , because of his wife the <unk> , <unk> .... <unk> the wife of Moses was of Madian , which <unk> upon the land of <unk> or Ethiopia : where note , that the Ethiopia here spoken of is not that of <unk> but that of Arabia .
And they said : Hath the Lord spoken by Moses only ?
Hath he not also spoken to us in like manner ?
And when the Lord heard this ,
( For Moses was a man exceeding meek above all men that dwelt upon earth ) <unk> meek .... Moses being the <unk> of men , would not contend for himself ; therefore , God inspired him to write here his own defence : and the Holy Spirit , whose <unk> he wrote , obliged him to declare the truth , though it was so much to his own praise .
<unk> he spoke to him , and to Aaron and Mary : Come out you three only to the tabernacle of the covenant .
And when they were come out ,
The Lord came down in a pillar of the cloud , and stood in the entry of the tabernacle calling to Aaron and Mary .
And when they were come ,
He said to them : Hear my words : if there be among you a prophet of the Lord , I will appear to him in a vision , or I will speak to him in a dream .
But it is not so with my servant Moses who is most faithful in all my house :
For I speak to him mouth to mouth : and plainly , and not by <unk> and figures doth he see the Lord .
Why then were you not afraid to speak ill of my servant Moses ?
And being angry with them he went away :
The cloud also that was over the tabernacle departed : and behold Mary appeared white as snow with a leprosy .
And when Aaron had looked on her , and saw her all covered with leprosy ,
He said to Moses : I beseech thee , my lord , lay not upon us this sin , which we have foolishly committed :
Let her not be as one dead , and as an <unk> that is cast forth from the mother ’ s womb .
Lo , now one half of her flesh is consumed with the leprosy .
And Moses cried to the Lord , saying O God , I beseech thee heal her .
And the Lord answered him : If her father had <unk> upon her face , ought she not to have been ashamed for seven days at least ?
Let her be separated seven days without the camp , and afterwards she shall be called again .
Mary therefore was put out of the camp seven days : and the people moved not from that place until Mary was called again .
Numbers Chapter 13 The twelve spies are sent to view the land .
The relation they make of it .
And the people marched from <unk> , and pitched their tents in the desert of Pharan .
And there the Lord spoke to Moses , saying .
Send men to view the land of Chanaan , which I will give to the children of Israel , one of every tribe , of the rulers .
Moses did what the Lord had commanded , sending from the desert of Pharan , principal men , whose names are these :
Of the tribe of Ruben , <unk> the son of <unk> .
Of the tribe of Simeon , <unk> the son of <unk> .
Of the tribe of Juda , Caleb the son of Jephone .
Of the tribe of Issachar , <unk> the son of Joseph .
Of the tribe of Ephraim , Osee the son of Nun .
Of the tribe of Benjamin , <unk> the son of <unk> .
Of the tribe of Zabulon , <unk> the son of <unk> .
Of the tribe of Joseph , of the sceptre of Manasses , <unk> the son of <unk> .
Of the tribe of Dan , <unk> the son of <unk> .
Of the tribe of Aser , <unk> the son of Michael .
Of the tribe of Nephtali , <unk> the son of <unk> .
Of the tribe of Gad , <unk> the son of <unk> .
These are the names of the men , whom Moses sent to view the land : and he called Osee the son of Nun , Josue .
And Moses sent them to view the land of Chanaan , and said to them : Go you up by the south side .
And when you shall come to the mountains ,
<unk> the land , of what sort it is , and the people that are the inhabitants thereof , whether they be strong or weak : few in number or many :
The land itself , whether it be good or bad : what manner of cities , walled or without walls :
The ground , fat or barren , <unk> or without trees .
Be of good courage , and bring us of the fruits of the land .
Now it was the time when the <unk> grapes are fit to be eaten .
And when they were gone up , they viewed the land from the desert of Sin , unto Rohob as you enter into Emath .
And they went up at the south side , and came to Hebron , where were <unk> and <unk> and <unk> the sons of <unk> .
For Hebron was built seven years before <unk> the city of Egypt .
And going forward as far as the torrent of the cluster of grapes , they cut off a branch with its cluster of grapes , which two men carried upon a <unk> .
They took also of the pomegranates and of the figs of that place :
Which was called <unk> , that is to say , the torrent of the cluster of grapes , because from thence the children of Israel had carried a cluster of grapes .
And they that went to spy out the land returned after forty days , having gone round all the country ,
And came to Moses and Aaron and to all the assembly of the children of Israel to the desert of Pharan , which is in Cades .
And speaking to them and to all the multitude , they shewed them the fruits of the land :
And they related and said : We came into the land to which thou <unk> us , which in very deed <unk> with milk and honey as may be known by these fruits :
But it hath very strong inhabitants , and the cities are great and walled .
We saw there the race of <unk> .
Amalec dwelleth in the south , the Hethite and the Jebusite and the Amorrhite in the mountains : but the Chanaanite abideth by the sea and near the streams of the Jordan .
In the mean time Caleb , to still the murmuring of the people that rose against Moses , said : Let us go up and possess the land , for we shall be able to <unk> it .
But the others , that had been with him , said : No , we are not able to go up to this people , because they are stronger than we .
And they spoke ill of the land , which they had viewed , before the children of Israel , saying : The land which we have viewed , <unk> its inhabitants : the people , that we beheld are of a tall stature .
<unk> ill , etc ....
These men , who by their <unk> of the land of promise , <unk> the Israelites from <unk> the <unk> of it , were a figure of <unk> , who , by <unk> or <unk> true <unk> , <unk> Christians from seeking in earnest and <unk> so great a good , and thereby <unk> to themselves a happy eternity .
There we saw certain <unk> of the sons of <unk> , of the <unk> kind : in comparison of whom , we seemed like locusts .
Numbers Chapter 14 The people murmur .
God <unk> to destroy them .
He is appeased by Moses , yet so as to <unk> the <unk> from entering the promised land .
The <unk> of the sedition are struck dead .
The rest going to fight against the will of God are beaten .
Therefore the whole multitude crying wept that night .
And all the children of Israel murmured against Moses and Aaron , saying :
Would God that we had died in Egypt : and would God we may die in this <unk> wilderness , and that the Lord may not bring us into this land , lest we fall by the sword , and our wives and children be led away captives .
Is it not better to return into Egypt ?
And they said one to another : Let us appoint a captain , and let us return into Egypt .
And when Moses and Aaron heard this , they fell down flat upon the ground before the multitude of the children of Israel .
But Josue the son of Nun , and Caleb the son of Jephone , who themselves also had viewed the land , rent their garments ,
And said to all the multitude of the children of Israel : The land which we have gone round is very good :
If the Lord be <unk> , he will bring us into it , and give us a land flowing with milk and honey .
Be not rebellious against the Lord : and fear ye not the people of this land , for we are able to eat them up as bread .
All aid is gone from them : the Lord is with us , fear ye not .
And when all the multitude cried out , and would have stoned them , the glory of the Lord appeared over the tabernacle of the covenant to all the children of Israel .
And the Lord said to Moses : How long will this people <unk> me ?
how long will they not believe me for all the signs that I have wrought before them ?
I will strike them therefore with pestilence , and will consume them : but thee I will make a ruler over a great nation , and a mightier than this is .
And Moses said to the Lord : That the Egyptians , from the midst of whom thou hast brought forth this people ,
And the inhabitants of this land , ( who have heard that thou , O Lord , art among this people , and art seen face to face , and thy cloud <unk> them , and thou goest before them in a pillar of a cloud by day , and in a pillar of fire by night , )
May hear that thou hast killed so great a multitude as it were one man and may say :
He could not bring the people into the land for which he had sworn , therefore did he kill them in the wilderness .
Let then the strength of the Lord be magnified , as thou hast sworn , saying :
The Lord is patient and full of mercy , by taking away iniquity and wickedness , and leaving no man clear , who <unk> the sins of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation .
<unk> .... <unk> <unk> . , who <unk> punishment .
<unk> , I beseech thee , the sins of this people , according to the greatness of thy mercy , as thou hast been merciful to them from their going out of Egypt unto this place .
And the Lord said : I have forgiven according to thy word .
As I live : and the whole earth shall be filled with the glory of the Lord .
But yet all the men that have seen my majesty , and the signs that I have done in Egypt , and in the wilderness , and have tempted me now ten times , and have not obeyed my voice ,
Shall not see the land for which I swore to their fathers , neither shall any one of them that hath <unk> me behold it .
My servant Caleb , who being full of another spirit hath followed me , I will bring into this land which he hath gone round : and his seed shall possess it .
For the <unk> and the Chanaanite dwell in the valleys .
To morrow remove the camp , and return into the wilderness by the way of the Red Sea .
And the Lord spoke to Moses and Aaron , saying :
How long doth this wicked multitude murmur against me ?
I have heard the <unk> of the children of Israel .
Say therefore to them : As I live , saith the Lord : According as you have spoken in my hearing , so will I do to you .
In the wilderness shall your carcasses lie .
All you that were numbered from twenty years old and upward , and have murmured against me ,
Shall not enter into the land , over which I lifted up my hand to make you dwell therein , except Caleb the son of Jephone , and Josue the son of Nun .
But your children , of whom you said , that they should be a prey to the enemies , will I bring in : that they may see the land which you have despised .
Your carcasses shall lie in the wilderness .
Your children shall wander in the desert forty years , and shall bear your fornication , until the carcasses of their fathers be consumed in the desert , Shall bear your fornication .... That is , shall bear the punishment of your <unk> to God , which in the scripture language is here called a fornication , in a spiritual sense .
According to the number of the forty days , wherein you viewed the land : a year shall be counted for a day .
And forty years you shall receive your iniquities , and shall know my revenge :
For as I have spoken , so will I do to all this wicked multitude , that hath risen up together against me : in this wilderness shall it faint away and die .
Therefore all the men , whom Moses had sent to view the land , and who at their return had made the whole multitude to murmur against him , speaking ill of the land that it was <unk> ,
<unk> and were struck in the sight of the Lord .
But Josue the son of Nun , and Caleb the son of Jephone lived , of all them that had gone to view the land .
And Moses spoke all these words to all the children of Israel , and the people mourned exceedingly .
And behold rising up very early in the morning , they went up to the top of the mountain , and said : We are ready to go up to the place , of which the Lord hath spoken : for we have sinned .
And Moses said to them : Why transgress you the word of the Lord , which shall not succeed prosperously with you ?
Go not up , for the Lord is not with you : lest you fall before your enemies .
The <unk> and the Chanaanite are before you , and by their sword you shall fall , because you would not consent to the Lord , neither will the Lord be with you .
But they being <unk> went up to the top of the mountain .
But the ark of the testament of the Lord and Moses departed not from the camp .
And the <unk> came down , and the Chanaanite that dwelt in the mountain : and <unk> and <unk> them pursued them as far as <unk> .
Numbers Chapter 15 <unk> laws concerning sacrifices .
<unk> breaking is punished with death .
The law of <unk> on their garments .
And the Lord spoke to Moses , saying :
Speak to the children of Israel and thou shalt say to them : When you shall be come unto the land of your habitation , which I will give you ,
And shall make an offering to the Lord , for a holocaust , or a victim , paying your vows , or <unk> offering gifts , or in your solemnities burning a sweet savour unto the Lord , of oxen or of sheep :
Whosoever <unk> the victim , shall offer a sacrifice of fine flour , the tenth part of an ephi , tempered with the fourth part of a hin of oil :
And he shall give the same measure of wine to pour out in libations for the holocaust or for the victim .
For every lamb ,
And for every ram there shall be a sacrifice of flour of two tenths , which shall be tempered with the third part of a hin of oil :
And he shall offer the third part the same measure of wine for the libation , for a sweet savour to the Lord .
But when thou <unk> a holocaust or sacrifice of oxen , to fulfil thy vow or for victims of peace offerings ,
Thou shalt give for every ox three tenths of flour tempered with half a hin of oil ,
And wine for libations of the same measure , for an offering of most sweet savour to the Lord .
Thus shalt thou do
For every ox and ram and lamb and kid .
Both they that are born in the land , and the strangers
Shall offer sacrifices after the same rite .
There shall be all one law and judgment both for you and for them who are strangers in the land .
And the Lord spoke to Moses , saying :
Speak to the children of Israel , and thou shalt say to them :
When you are come into the land which I will give you ,
And shall eat of the bread of that country , you shall separate firstfruits to the Lord ,
Of the things you eat .
As you separate firstfruits of your <unk> :
So also shall you give firstfruits of your <unk> to the Lord .
And if through ignorance you <unk> any of these things , which the Lord hath spoken to Moses ,
And by him hath commanded you from the day that he began to command and <unk> ,
And the multitude have forgotten to do it : they shall offer a calf out of the herd , a holocaust for a most sweet savour to the Lord , and the sacrifice and libations thereof , as the ceremonies require , and a buck goat for sin :
And the priest shall pray for all the multitude of the children of Israel : and it shall be forgiven them , because they sinned <unk> , offering notwithstanding a burnt offering to the Lord for themselves and for their sin and their <unk> :
And it shall be forgiven all the people of the children of Israel : and the strangers that sojourn among them : because it is the fault of all the people through ignorance .
But if one soul shall sin <unk> , he shall offer a she goat of a year old for his sin .
And the priest shall pray for him , because he sinned <unk> before the Lord : and he shall obtain his pardon , and it shall be forgiven him .
The same law shall be for all that sin by ignorance , whether they be <unk> or strangers .
But the soul that committeth any thing through pride , whether he be born in the land or a stranger ( because he hath been rebellious against the Lord ) shall be cut off from among his people :
For he hath <unk> the word of the Lord , and made void his precept : therefore shall he be destroyed , and shall bear his iniquity .
And it came to pass , when the children of Israel were in the wilderness , and had found a man gathering <unk> on the sabbath day ,
That they brought him to Moses and Aaron and the whole multitude .
And they put him into prison , not knowing what they should do with him .
And the Lord said to Moses : Let that man die , let all the multitude stone him without the camp .
And when they had brought him out , they stoned him , and he died as the Lord had commanded .
The Lord also said to Moses :
Speak to the children of Israel , and thou shalt tell them to make to themselves <unk> in the corners of their garments , putting in them <unk> of blue : <unk> ....
The Pharisees enlarged these <unk> through <unk> , Matt .
<unk> , to appear more zealous than other men for the law of God .
That when they shall see them , they may remember all the commandments of the Lord , and not follow their own thoughts and eyes going astray after divers things ,
But rather being mindful of the precepts of the Lord , may do them and be holy to their God .
I am the Lord your God , who brought you out of the land of Egypt , that I might be your God .
Numbers Chapter 16 The <unk> of Core and his <unk> : their punishment .
And behold Core the son of Isaar , the son of Caath , the son of Levi , and Dathan and Abiron the sons of Eliab , and <unk> the son of <unk> of the children of Ruben ,
<unk> up against Moses , and with them two hundred and fifty others of the children of Israel , <unk> men of the synagogue , and who in the time of assembly were called by name .
<unk> up ....
The crime of these men , which was punished in so <unk> a manner , was that of <unk> , and of <unk> against the authority established by God in the church ; and their <unk> to the priesthood without being <unk> called and sent : the same is the case of all <unk> <unk> .
And when they had stood up against Moses and Aaron , they said : Let it be enough for you , that all the multitude <unk> of holy ones , and the Lord is among them : Why lift you up yourselves above the people of the Lord ?
When Moses heard this , he fell flat on his face :
And speaking to Core and all the multitude , he said : In the morning the Lord will make known who belong to him , and the holy he will join to himself : and whom he shall choose , they shall approach to him .
Do this therefore : Take every man of you your censers , thou Core , and all thy company .
And putting fire in them to morrow , put incense upon it before the Lord : and whomsoever he shall choose , the same shall be holy : you take too much upon you , ye sons of Levi .
And he said again to Core : Hear ye sons of Levi .
Is it a small thing unto you , that the God of Israel hath spared you from all the people , and joined you to himself , that you should serve him in the service of the tabernacle , and should stand before the congregation of the people , and should minister to him ?
Did he therefore make thee and all thy brethren the sons of Levi to approach unto him , that you should <unk> to yourselves the priesthood also ,
And that all thy company should stand against the Lord ?
for what is Aaron that you murmur against him ?
Then Moses sent to call Dathan and Abiron the sons of Eliab .
But they answered : We will not come .
Is it a small matter to thee , that thou hast brought us out of a land that <unk> with milk and honey , to kill us in the desert , except thou rule also like a lord over us ?
Thou hast brought us indeed into a land that <unk> with rivers of milk and honey , and hast given us possessions of fields and vineyards ; wilt thou also pull out our eyes ?
We will not come .
Moses therefore being very angry , said to the Lord : <unk> not their sacrifices : thou knowest that I have not taken of them so much as a young ass at any time , nor have <unk> any of them .
<unk> angry ....
This anger was a zeal against sin ; and an indignation at the <unk> offered to God ; like that which the same holy prophet conceived upon the sight of the golden calf , Ex .
<unk> .
And he said to Core : Do thou and thy congregation stand apart before the Lord to morrow , and Aaron apart .
Take every one of you censers , and put incense upon them , offering to the Lord two hundred and fifty censers : let Aaron also hold his <unk> .
When they had done this , Moses and Aaron standing ,
And had drawn up all the multitude against them to the door of the tabernacle , the glory of the Lord appeared to them all .
And the Lord speaking to Moses and Aaron , said :
<unk> yourselves from among this congregation , that I may presently destroy them .
They fell flat on their face , and said : O most mighty , the God of the spirits of all flesh , for one man ’ s sin shall thy wrath rage against all ?
And the Lord said to Moses :
Command the whole people to separate themselves from the tents of Core and Dathan and Abiron .
And Moses arose , and went to Dathan and Abiron : and the ancients of Israel following him ,
He said to the multitude : Depart from the tents of these wicked men , and touch nothing of theirs , lest you be <unk> in their sins .
And when they were departed from their tents round about , Dathan and Abiron coming out stood in the entry of their <unk> with their wives and children , and all the people .
And Moses said : By this you shall know that the Lord hath sent me to do all things that you see , and that I have not <unk> them of my own head :
If these men die the common death of men , and if they be visited with a plague , wherewith others also are wont to be visited , the Lord did not send me .
But if the Lord do a new thing , and the earth opening her mouth swallow them down , and all things that belong to them , and they go down alive into hell , you shall know that they have blasphemed the Lord .
And immediately as he had made an end of speaking , the earth broke asunder under their feet :
And opening her mouth , devoured them with their tents and all their substance .
And they went down alive into hell , the ground <unk> upon them , and they perished from among the people .
But all Israel , that was standing round about , fled at the cry of them that were <unk> : saying : Lest perhaps the earth swallow us up also .
And a fire coming out from the Lord , destroyed the two hundred and fifty men that offered the incense .
And the Lord spoke to Moses , saying :
Command Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest to take up the censers that lie in the burning , and to scatter the fire of one side and the other : because they are sanctified
In the <unk> of the sinners : and let him beat them into plates , and <unk> them to the altar , because incense hath been offered in them to the Lord , and they are sanctified , that the children of Israel may see them for a sign and a memorial .
Then Eleazar the priest took the brazen censers , wherein they had offered , whom the burning fire had devoured , and beat them into plates , <unk> them to the altar :
That the children of Israel might have for the time to come wherewith they should be admonished , that no stranger or any one that is not of the seed of Aaron should come near to offer incense to the Lord , lest he should suffer as Core suffered , and all his congregation , according as the Lord spoke to Moses .
The following day all the multitude of the children of Israel murmured against Moses and Aaron , saying : You have killed the people of the Lord .
And when there arose a sedition , and the tumult increased ,
Moses and Aaron fled to the tabernacle of the covenant .
And when they were gone into it , the cloud covered it , and the glory of the Lord appeared .
And the Lord said to Moses :
Get you out from the midst of this multitude , this moment will I destroy them .
And as they were lying on the ground ,
Moses said to Aaron : Take the <unk> , and putting fire in it from the altar , put incense upon it , and go quickly to the people to pray for them : for already wrath is gone out from the Lord , and the plague <unk> .
When Aaron had done this , and had run to the midst of the multitude which the burning fire was now destroying , he offered the incense :
And standing between the dead and the living , he prayed for the people , and the plague ceased .
And the number of them that were slain was fourteen thousand and seven hundred men , besides them that had perished in the sedition of Core .
And Aaron returned to Moses to the door of the tabernacle of the covenant after the destruction was over .
Numbers Chapter 17 The priesthood is confirmed to Aaron by the miracle of the <unk> of his rod , which is kept for a monument in the tabernacle .
And the Lord spoke to Moses , saying :
Speak to the children of Israel , and take of every one of them a rod by their kindreds , of all the princes of the tribes , twelve rods , and write the name of every man upon his rod .
And the name of Aaron shall be for the tribe of Levi , and one rod shall contain all their families :
And thou shalt lay them up in the tabernacle of the covenant before the testimony , where I will speak to thee .
<unk> of these I shall choose , his rod shall <unk> : and I will make to cease from me the <unk> of the children of Israel , wherewith they murmur against you .
And Moses spoke to the children of Israel : and all the princes gave him rods one for every tribe : and there were twelve rods besides the rod of Aaron .
And when Moses had <unk> them up before the Lord in the tabernacle of the testimony :
He returned on the following day , and found that the rod of Aaron for the house of Levi , was <unk> : and that the <unk> swelling it had <unk> <unk> , which spreading the leaves , were formed into <unk> .
The rod of Aaron for the house of Levi , was <unk> , etc ....
This rod of Aaron which thus <unk> brought forth fruit , was a figure of the blessed <unk> <unk> and bringing forth her Son without any <unk> to her virginity .
Moses therefore brought out all the rods from before the Lord to all the children of Israel : and they saw , and every one received their rods .
And the Lord said to Moses : <unk> back the rod of Aaron into the tabernacle of the testimony , that it may be kept there for a token of the rebellious children of Israel , and that their <unk> may cease from me lest they die .
And Moses did as the Lord had commanded .
And the children of Israel said to Moses : Behold we are consumed , we all perish .
Whosoever <unk> to the tabernacle of the Lord , he dieth .
Are we all to a man to be utterly destroyed ?
Numbers Chapter 18 The charge of the priests and of the Levites , and their portion .
And the Lord said to Aaron : Thou , and thy sons , and thy father ’ s house with thee shall bear the iniquity of the sanctuary : and thou and thy sons with thee shall bear the sins of your priesthood .
Thou , and thy father ’ s house with thee , shall bear the iniquity of the sanctuary .... That is , you shall be punished if , through <unk> or want of due <unk> , you err in the <unk> of the sacred functions for which you were ordained .
And take with thee thy brethren also of the tribe of Levi , and the sceptre of thy father , and let them be ready in hand , and minister to thee : but thou and thy sons shall minister in the tabernacle of the testimony .
And the Levites shall watch to do thy commands , and about all the works of the tabernacle : only they shall not come nigh the vessels of the sanctuary nor the altar , lest both they die , and you also perish with them .
But let them be with thee , and watch in the charge of the tabernacle , and in all the ceremonies thereof .
A stranger shall not join himself with you .
Watch ye in the charge of the sanctuary , and in the ministry of the altar : lest indignation rise upon the children of Israel .
I have given you your brethren the Levites from among the children of Israel , and have delivered them for a gift to the Lord , to serve in the <unk> of the tabernacle .
But thou and thy sons look ye to the priesthood : and all things that <unk> to the service of the altar , and that are within the veil , shall be executed by the priests .
If any stranger shall approach , he shall be slain .
And the Lord said to Aaron : Behold I have given thee the charge of my firstfruits .
All things that are sanctified by the children of Israel , I have delivered to thee and to thy sons for the priestly office , by everlasting ordinances .
These therefore shalt thou take of the things that are sanctified , and are offered to the Lord .
Every offering , and sacrifice , and whatsoever is rendered to me for sin and for trespass , and becometh holy of holies , shall be for thee and thy sons .
Thou shalt eat it in the sanctuary : the males only shall eat thereof , because it is a consecrated thing to thee .
But the firstfruits , which the children of Israel shall vow and offer , I have given to thee , and to thy sons , and to thy daughters , by a perpetual law .
He that is clean in thy house , shall eat them .
All the best of the oil , and of the wine , and of the corn , whatsoever firstfruits they offer to the Lord , I have given them to thee .
All the <unk> of the fruits , that the ground bringeth forth , and which are brought to the Lord , shall be for thy use : he that is clean in thy house , shall eat them .
Every thing that the children of Israel shall give by vow , shall be thine .
Whatsoever is firstborn of all flesh , which they offer to the Lord , whether it be of men , or of beasts , shall belong to thee : only for the firstborn of man thou shalt take a price , and every beast that is unclean thou shalt cause to be redeemed ,
And the redemption of it shall be after one month , for five sicles of silver , by the weight of the sanctuary .
A sicle hath twenty <unk> .
But the <unk> of a cow , and of a sheep and of a goat thou shalt not cause to be redeemed , because they are sanctified to the Lord .
Their blood only thou shalt pour upon the altar , and their fat thou shalt burn for a most sweet odour to the Lord .
But the flesh shall fall to thy use , as the consecrated breast , and the right shoulder shall be thine .
All the firstfruits of the sanctuary which the children of Israel offer to the Lord , I have given to thee and to thy sons and daughters , by a perpetual ordinance .
It is a covenant of salt for ever before the Lord , to thee and to thy sons .
A covenant of salt ....
It is a <unk> <unk> , signifying a covenant not to be <unk> or corrupted ; as salt is used to keep things from corruption ; a covenant perpetual , like that by which it was appointed , that salt should be used in every sacrifice .

And the Lord said to Aaron : You shall possess nothing in their land , neither shall you have a portion among them : I am thy portion and inheritance in the midst of the children of Israel .
And I have given to the sons of Levi all the tithes of Israel for a possession , for the ministry wherewith they serve me in the tabernacle of the covenant :
That the children of Israel may not approach any more to the tabernacle , nor commit <unk> sin , <unk> sin .... That is , sin which will bring death after it .
But only the sons of Levi may serve me in the tabernacle , and bear the sins of the people .
It shall be an everlasting ordinance in your generations .
They shall not possess any other thing ,
But be content with the oblation or tithes , which I have separated for their uses and necessities .
And the Lord spoke to Moses , saying :
Command the Levites , and declare unto them : When you shall receive of the children of Israel the tithes , which I have given you , offer the firstfruits of them to the Lord , that is to say , the tenth part of the tenth :
That it may be reckoned to you as an oblation of firstfruits , as well of the <unk> as of the <unk> :
And of all the things of which you receive tithes , offer the firstfruits to the Lord , and give them to Aaron the priest .
All the things that you shall offer of the tithes , and shall separate for the gifts of the Lord , shall be the best and choicest things .
And thou shalt say to them : If you offer all the goodly and the better things of the tithes , it shall be reckoned to you as if you had given the firstfruits of the <unk> and the winepress :
And you shall eat them in all your places , both you and your families : because it is your reward for the ministry , wherewith you serve in the tabernacle of the testimony .
And you shall not sin in this point , by <unk> the choicest and fat things to yourselves , lest you profane the oblations of the children of Israel , and die .
Numbers Chapter 19 The law of the sacrifice of the red cow , and the water of expiation .
And the Lord spoke to Moses and Aaron , saying :
This is the observance of the victim , which the Lord hath ordained .
Command the children of Israel , that they bring unto thee a red cow of full age , in which there is no blemish , and which hath not carried the yoke : A red cow , etc ....
This red cow , offered in sacrifice for sin , and consumed with fire without the camp , with the ashes of which , mingled with water , the unclean were to be <unk> and purified ; was a figure of the passion of Christ , by whose precious blood applied to our souls in the holy sacraments , we are cleansed from our sins .
And you shall deliver her to Eleazar the priest , who shall bring her forth without the camp , and shall immolate her in the sight of all :
And <unk> his finger in her blood , shall sprinkle it over against the door of the tabernacle seven times ,
And shall burn her in the sight of all delivering up to the fire her skin , and her flesh , and her blood , and her dung .
The priest shall also take cedar wood , and hyssop , and scarlet twice dyed , and cast it into the flame , with which the cow is consumed .
And then after washing his garments , and body , he shall enter into the camp , and shall be unclean until the evening .
He also that hath burned her , shall wash his garments , and his body , and shall be unclean until the evening .
And a man that is clean shall gather up the ashes of the cow , and shall pour them forth without the camp in a most clean place , that they may be reserved for the multitude of the children of Israel , and for a water of <unk> : because the cow was burnt for sin .
And when he that carried the ashes of the cow , hath washed his garments , he shall be unclean until the evening .
The children of Israel , and the strangers that dwell among them , shall observe this for a holy thing by a perpetual ordinance .
He that toucheth the <unk> of a man , and is therefore unclean seven days ,
Shall be sprinkled with this water on the third day , and on the seventh , and so shall be cleansed .
If he were not sprinkled on the third day , he cannot be cleansed on the seventh .
Every one that toucheth the <unk> of a man , and is not sprinkled with this <unk> , shall profane the tabernacle of the Lord , and shall perish out of Israel : because he was not sprinkled with the water of expiation , he shall be unclean , and his uncleanness shall remain upon him .
This is the law of a man that dieth in a tent : All that go into his tent and all the vessels that are there , shall be unclean seven days .
The vessel that hath no cover , nor binding over it , shall be unclean .
If any man in the field touch the <unk> of a man that was slain , or that died of himself , or his bone , or his grave , he shall be unclean seven days .
And they shall take of the ashes of the burning and of the sin offering , and shall pour living waters upon them into a vessel .
And a man that is clean shall dip hyssop in them , and shall sprinkle therewith all the tent , and all the furniture , and the men that are defiled with touching any such thing :
And in this manner he that is clean shall purify the unclean on the third and on the seventh day .
And being <unk> the seventh day , he shall wash both himself and his garments , and be unclean until the evening .
If any man be not <unk> after this rite , his soul shall perish out of the midst of the church : because he hath profaned the sanctuary of the Lord , and was not sprinkled with the water of purification .
This precept shall be an ordinance for ever .
He also that sprinkled the water , shall wash his garments .
Every one that shall touch the waters of expiation , shall be unclean until the evening .
Whatsoever a person toucheth who is unclean , he shall make it unclean : and the person that toucheth any of these things , shall be unclean until the evening .
Numbers Chapter 20 The death of Mary the sister of Moses .
The people murmur for want of water : God giveth it them from the rock .
The death of Aaron .
And the children of Israel , and all the multitude came into the desert of Sin , in the first month : and the people abode in Cades .
And Mary died there , and was buried in the same place .
And the people wanting water , came together against Moses and Aaron :
And making a sedition , they said : Would God we had perished among our brethren before the Lord .
Why have you brought out the church of the Lord into the wilderness , that both we and our cattle should die ?
Why have you made us come up out of Egypt , and have brought us into this wretched place which cannot be sowed , nor bringeth forth figs , nor vines , nor pomegranates , neither is there any water to drink ?
And Moses and Aaron leaving the multitude , went into the tabernacle of the covenant , and fell flat upon the ground , and cried to the Lord , and said .
O Lord God , hear the cry of this people , and open to them thy treasure , a fountain of living water , that being satisfied , they may cease to murmur .
And the glory of the Lord appeared over them .
And the Lord spoke to Moses , saying :
Take the rod , and assemble the people together , thou and Aaron thy brother , and speak to the rock before them , and it shall yield waters .
And when thou hast brought forth water out of the rock , all the multitude and their cattle shall drink .
Moses therefore took the rod , which was before the Lord , as he had commanded him ,
And having gathered together the multitude before the rock , he said to them : Hear , ye rebellious and incredulous : Can we bring you forth water out of this rock ?
And when Moses had lifted up his hand , and struck the rock twice with the rod , there came forth water in great abundance , so that the people and their cattle drank , The rock ....
This rock was a figure of Christ , and the water that <unk> out from the rock , of his precious blood , the <unk> of all our good .
And the Lord said to Moses and Aaron : Because you have not believed me , to sanctify me before the children of Israel , you shall not bring these people into the land , which I will give them .
You have not believed , etc ....
The fault of Moses and Aaron , on this occasion , was a certain <unk> and weakness of faith ; not <unk> of God ’ s power or <unk> ; but <unk> the <unk> of that rebellious and incredulous people , and therefore speaking with some <unk> .
This is the <unk> of contradiction , where the children of Israel <unk> with words against the Lord , and he was sanctified in them .
The <unk> of contradiction .... Or strife .
Hebrew , <unk> .
In the mean time Moses sent messengers from Cades to the king of Edom , to say : Thus saith thy brother Israel : Thou knowest all the labour that hath come upon us :
In what manner our fathers went down into Egypt , and there we dwelt a long time , and the Egyptians afflicted us and our fathers .
And how we cried to the Lord , and he heard us , and sent an angel , who hath brought us out of Egypt .
Lo , we are now in the city of Cades , which is in the uttermost of thy borders ,
And we beseech thee that we may have leave to pass through thy country .
We will not go through the fields , nor through the vineyards , we will not drink the waters of thy <unk> , but we will go by the common <unk> , neither turning aside to the right hand , nor to the left , till we are past thy borders .
And Edom answered them : Thou shalt not pass by me : if thou dost I will come out armed against thee .
And the children of Israel said : We will go by the beaten way : and if we and our cattle drink of thy waters , we will give thee what is just : there shall be no <unk> in the price , only let us pass speedily .
But he answered : Thou shalt not pass .
And immediately he came forth to meet them with an infinite multitude , and a strong hand ,
Neither would he <unk> to their desire to grant them passage through his borders .
Wherefore Israel turned another way from him .
And when they had removed the camp from Cades , they came to mount <unk> , which is in the borders of the land of Edom :
Where the Lord spoke to Moses :
Let Aaron , saith he , go to his people : for he shall not go into the land which I have given the children of Israel , because he was incredulous to my words , at the waters of contradiction .
Take Aaron and his son with him , and bring them up into mount <unk> :
And when thou hast stripped the father of his vesture , thou shalt <unk> therewith Eleazar his son : Aaron shall be gathered to his people , and die there .
Moses did as the Lord had commanded : and they went up into mount <unk> before all the multitude .
And when he had stripped Aaron of his vestments , he vested Eleazar his son with them .
And Aaron being dead in the top of the mountain , he came down with Eleazar .
And all the multitude seeing that Aaron was dead , mourned for him thirty days throughout all their families .
Numbers Chapter 21 King <unk> is overcome .
The people murmur and are punished with fiery serpents : they are healed by the brazen serpent .
They <unk> the kings Sehon and Og .
And when king <unk> the Chanaanite , who dwelt towards the south , had heard this , to wit , that Israel was come by the way of the spies , he fought against them , and <unk> them carried off their spoils .
But Israel binding himself by vow to the Lord , said : If thou wilt deliver this people into my hand , I will utterly destroy their cities .
And the Lord heard the prayers of Israel , and delivered up the Chanaanite , and they cut them off and destroyed their cities : and they called the name of that place <unk> , that is to say , <unk> .
<unk> .... That is , a thing <unk> to utter destruction .
And they marched from mount <unk> , by the way that leadeth to the Red Sea , to compass the land of Edom .
And the people began to be weary of their journey and labour :
And speaking against God and Moses , they said : Why didst thou bring us out of Egypt , to die in the wilderness ?
There is no bread , nor have we any waters : our soul now <unk> this very light food .
<unk> light food ....
So they call the heavenly manna : thus <unk> <unk> the things of heaven , for which they have no <unk> .
Wherefore the Lord sent among the people fiery serpents , which <unk> them and killed many of them .
<unk> serpents ....
They are so called , because they that were <unk> by them were burnt with a violent heat .
Upon which they came to Moses , and said ; We have sinned , because we have spoken against the Lord and thee : pray that he may take away these serpents from us .
And Moses prayed for the people .
And the Lord said to him : Make a brazen serpent , and set it up for a sign : whosoever being struck shall look on it , shall live .
Moses therefore made a brazen serpent , and set it up for a sign : which when they that were <unk> looked upon , they were healed .
A brazen serpent ....
This was a figure of Christ crucified , and of the <unk> of a <unk> faith in him , against the <unk> of the <unk> serpent .
John <unk> .
And the children of Israel setting <unk> camped in <unk> .
And departing thence they pitched their tents in <unk> , in the wilderness , that <unk> Moab toward the east .
And <unk> from thence , they came to the torrent <unk> :
Which they left and encamped over against Arnon , which is in the desert and standeth out on the borders of the Amorrhite .
For Arnon is the border of Moab , <unk> the Moabites and the Amorrhites .
Wherefore it is said in the book of the wars of the Lord : As he did in the Red Sea , so will he do in the streams of Arnon .
The book of the wars , etc .... An ancient book , which , like several others <unk> in scripture , has been lost .
The rocks of the torrents were bowed down that they might rest in <unk> , and lie down in the borders of the Moabites .
When they went from that place , the well appeared whereof the Lord said to Moses : Gather the people together , and I will give them water .
Then Israel sung this song : Let the well spring up .
They sung <unk> :
The well , which the princes dug , and the chiefs of the people prepared by the <unk> of the <unk> , and with their staves .
And they marched from the wilderness to <unk> .
From <unk> unto <unk> : from <unk> unto <unk> .
From <unk> , is a valley in the country of Moab , to the top of <unk> , which looked towards the desert .
And Israel sent messengers to Sehon king of the Amorrhites , saying :
I beseech thee that I may have leave to pass through thy land : we will not go aside into the fields or the vineyards , we will not drink waters of the <unk> , we will go the king ’ s <unk> , till we be past thy borders .
And he would not grant that Israel should pass by his borders : but rather gathering an army , went forth to meet them in the desert , and came to <unk> and fought against them .
And he was slain by them with the edge of the sword , and they possessed his land from the Arnon unto the <unk> , and to the confines of the children of Ammon : for the borders of the Ammonites , were kept with a strong garrison .
So Israel took all his cities , and dwelt in the cities of the Amorrhite , to wit , in Hesebon , and in the villages thereof .
Hesebon was the city of Sehon the king of the Amorrhites , who fought against the king of Moab : and took all the land , that had been of his dominion , as far as the Arnon .
Therefore it is said in the proverb : Come into Hesebon , let the city of Sehon be built and set up :
A fire is gone out of Hesebon , a flame from the city of Sehon , and hath consumed <unk> of the Moabites , and the inhabitants of the high places of the Arnon .
Woe to thee Moab : thou art <unk> , O people of Chamos .
He hath given his sons to flight , and his daughters into captivity to Sehon the king of the Amorrhites .
Their yoke is perished from Hesebon unto Dibon , they came weary to <unk> , and unto <unk> .
So Israel dwelt in the land of the Amorrhite .
And Moses sent some to take a view of Jazer : and they took the villages of it , and conquered the inhabitants .
And they turned themselves , and went up by the way of Basan , and Og the king of Basan came against them with all his people , to fight in <unk> .
And the Lord said to Moses : Fear him not , for I have delivered him and all his people , and his country into thy hand : and thou shalt do to him as thou didst to Sehon the king of the Amorrhites , the inhabitant of Hesebon .
So they slew him also with his sons , and all his people , not <unk> any one escape , and they possessed his land .
Numbers Chapter 22 Balac , king of Moab , sendeth twice for Balaam to curse Israel .
In his way Balaam is rebuked by an angel .
And they went forward and encamped in the plains of Moab , over against where Jericho is situate beyond the Jordan .
And Balac the son of <unk> , seeing all that Israel had done to the Amorrhite ,
And that the Moabites were in great fear of him , and were not able to <unk> his assault ,
He said to the elders of Madian : So will this people destroy all that dwell in our borders , as the ox is wont to eat the grass to the very roots .
Now he was at that time king in Moab .
He sent therefore messengers to Balaam the son of Beor , a <unk> , who dwelt by the river of the land of the children of Ammon , to call him , and to say : Behold a people is come out of Egypt , that hath covered the face of the earth , sitting over against me .
Come therefore , and curse this people , because it is mightier than I : if by any means I may beat them and drive them out of my land : for I know that he whom thou shalt bless is blessed , and he whom thou shalt curse is cursed .
And the ancients of Moab , and the elders of Madian , went with the price of <unk> in their hands .
And where they were come to Balaam , and had told him all the words of Balac :
He answered : <unk> here this night and I will answer whatsoever the Lord shall say to me .
And while they stayed with Balaam , God came and said to him :
What mean these men that are with thee ?
He answered : Balac the son of <unk> king of the Moabites hath sent to me ,
Saying : Behold a people that is come out of Egypt , hath covered the face of the land : come and curse them , if by any means I may fight with them and drive them away .
And God said to Balaam : Thou shalt not go with them , nor shalt thou curse the people : because it is blessed .
And he rose in the morning and said to the princes : Go into your country , because the Lord hath forbid me to come with you .
The princes returning , said to Balac : Balaam would not come with us .
Then he sent many more and more noble than he had sent before : 22 : 16 . Who , when they were come to Balaam , said : Thus saith Balac the son of <unk> , <unk> not to come to me :
For I am ready to honour thee , and will give thee whatsoever thou wilt : come and curse this people .
Balaam answered : If Balac would give me his house full of silver and gold , I cannot <unk> the word of the Lord my God , to speak either more or less .
I pray you to stay here this night also , that I may know what the Lord will answer me once more .
To stay .... His desiring them to stay , after he had been fully <unk> already that it was not God ’ s will he should go , came from the <unk> he had to <unk> Balac , for the sake of worldly gain .
And this perverse disposition God punished by <unk> him to go ( though not to curse the people as he would willingly have done ) , and suffering him to fall still <unk> and <unk> into sin , till he came at last to give that abominable counsel against the people of God , which ended in his own destruction .
So sad a thing it is to <unk> a passion for money .
God therefore came to Balaam in the night , and said to him : If these men be come to call thee , arise and go with them : yet so , that thou do what I shall command thee .
Balaam arose in the morning , and <unk> his ass went with them .
And God was angry .
And an angel of the Lord stood in the way against Balaam , who sat on the ass , and had two servants with him .
The ass seeing the angel standing in the way , with a drawn sword , turned herself out of the way , and went into the field .
And when Balaam beat her , and had a mind to bring her again to the way ,
The angel stood in a narrow place between two walls , wherewith the vineyards were enclosed .
And the ass seeing him , thrust herself close to the wall , and bruised the foot of the rider .
But he beat her again :
And nevertheless the angel going on to a narrow place , where there was no way to turn aside either to the right hand or to the left , stood to meet him .
And when the ass saw the angel standing , she fell under the feet of the rider : who being angry beat her sides more <unk> with a staff .
And the Lord opened the mouth of the ass , and she said : What have I done to thee ?
Why <unk> thou me , lo , now this third time ?
<unk> the mouth , etc ....
The angel moved the tongue of the ass , to utter these speeches , to rebuke , by the mouth of a <unk> beast , the <unk> fury and folly of Balaam .
Balaam answered : Because thou hast deserved it , and hast served me ill : I would I had a sword that I might kill thee .
The ass said : Am not I thy beast , on which thou hast been always accustomed to <unk> until this present day ?
tell me if I ever did the like thing to thee .
But he said : <unk> .
<unk> the Lord opened the eyes of Balaam , and he saw the angel standing in the way with a drawn sword , and he worshipped him falling flat on the ground .
And the angel said to him : Why <unk> thou thy ass these three times ?
I am come to withstand thee , because thy way is perverse , and contrary to me : <unk> .... Because thy <unk> are wicked in being willing for the sake of gain to curse the people of whom I am the <unk> .
And unless the ass had turned out of the way , giving place to me who stood against thee , I had slain thee , and she should have lived .
Balaam said : I have sinned , not knowing that thou didst stand against me : and now if it <unk> thee that I go , I will return .
The angel said : Go with these men , and see thou speak no other thing than what I shall command thee .
He went therefore with the princes .
And when Balac heard it he came forth to meet him in a town of the Moabites , that is situate in the uttermost borders of Arnon .
And he said to Balaam : I sent messengers to call thee , why didst thou not come immediately to me ?
was it because I am not able to reward thy coming ?
He answered him : Lo , here I am : shall I have power to speak any other thing but that which God shall put in my mouth ?
So they went on together , and came into a city , that was in the uttermost borders of his kingdom .
And when Balac had killed oxen and sheep , he sent presents to Balaam , and to the princes that were with him .
And when morning was come , he brought him to the high places of Baal , and he beheld the uttermost part of the people .
Numbers Chapter 23 Balaam , instead of cursing Israel , is obliged to bless them , and prophesy good things of them .
And Balaam said to Balac : <unk> me here seven altars , and prepare as many calves , and the same number of rams .
And when he had done according to the word of Balaam , they laid together a calf and a ram upon every altar .
And Balaam said to Balac : Stand a while by thy burnt offering , until I go , to see if perhaps the Lord will meet me , and whatsoever he shall command , I will speak to thee .
And when he was gone with speed , God met him .
And Balaam speaking to him , said : I have erected seven altars , and have laid on <unk> a calf and a ram .
And the Lord put the word in his mouth , and said : Return to Balac , and thus shalt thou speak .
<unk> he found Balac standing by his burnt offering , with all the princes of the Moabites :
And taking up his parable , he said : Balac king of the Moabites hath brought me from Aram , from the mountains of the east : Come , said he , and curse Jacob : make haste and <unk> Israel .
How shall I curse him , whom God hath not cursed ?
By what means should I <unk> him , whom the Lord <unk> not ?
I shall see him from the tops of the rocks , and shall consider him from the hills .
This people shall dwell alone , and shall not be reckoned among the nations .
23 : 10 . Who can count the dust of Jacob , and know the number of the stock of Israel ?
Let my soul die the death of the just , and my last end be like to them .
And Balac said to Balaam : What is this that thou dost ?
I sent for thee to curse my enemies : and thou <unk> <unk> them .
He answered him : Can I speak any thing else but what the Lord commandeth ?
Balac therefore said : Come with me to another place from whence thou mayest see part of Israel , and canst not see them all : curse them from thence .
And when he had brought him to a high place , upon the top of mount <unk> , Balaam built seven altars , and laying on every one a calf and a ram ,
He said to Balac : Stand here by thy burnt offering while I go to meet him .
And when the Lord had met him , and had put the word in his mouth , he said : Return to Balac , and thus shalt thou say to him .
<unk> he found him standing by his burnt sacrifice , and the princes of the Moabites with him .
And Balac said to him : What hath the Lord spoken ?
But he taking up his parable , said : Stand , O Balac , and give ear : hear , thou son of <unk> :
God is not a man , that he should lie , nor is the son of man , that he should be changed .
Hath he said then , and will he not do ?
hath he spoken , and will he not fulfil ?
I was brought to bless , the blessing I am not able to hinder .
There is no idol in Jacob , neither is there an image god to be seen in Israel .
The Lord his God is with him , and the sound of the victory of the king in him .
God hath brought him out of Egypt , whose strength is like to the <unk> .
There is no <unk> in Jacob , nor <unk> in Israel .
In their times it shall be told to Jacob and to Israel what God hath wrought .
Behold the people shall rise up as a lioness , and shall lift itself up as a lion : it shall not lie down till it devour the prey , and drink the blood of the slain .
And Balac said to Balaam : Neither curse , nor bless him .
And he said : Did I not tell thee , that whatsoever God should command me , that I would do ?
And Balac said to him : Come and I will bring thee to another place ; if <unk> it please God that thou mayest curse them from thence .
And when he had brought him upon the top of mount <unk> , which looketh towards the wilderness ,
Balaam said to him : <unk> me here seven altars , and prepare as many calves , and the same number of rams .
Balac did as Balaam had said : and he laid on every altar , a calf and a ram .
Numbers Chapter 24 Balaam still <unk> to prophesy good things in favour of Israel .
And when Balaam saw that it pleased the Lord that he should bless Israel , he went not as he had gone before , to seek <unk> : but setting his face towards the desert ,
And lifting up his eyes , he saw Israel <unk> in their tents by their tribes : and the spirit of God <unk> upon him ,
He took up his parable and said : Balaam the son of Beor hath said : The man hath said , whose eye is stopped up :
The <unk> of the words of God hath said , he that hath beheld the vision of the Almighty , he that falleth , and so his eyes are opened :
How beautiful are thy tabernacles O Jacob , and thy tents , O Israel !
As <unk> valleys , as watered gardens near the rivers , as tabernacles which the Lord hath pitched , as cedars by the <unk> .
<unk> shall flow out of his <unk> , and his seed shall be in many waters .
For Agag his king shall be removed , and his kingdom shall be taken away .
God hath brought him out of Egypt , whose strength is like to the <unk> .
They shall devour the nations that are his enemies , and break their bones , and <unk> them with arrows .
<unk> down he hath slept as a lion , and as a lioness , whom none shall dare to <unk> .
He that blesseth thee , shall also himself be blessed : he that curseth thee shall be reckoned <unk> .
And Balac being angry against Balaam , <unk> his hands together and said : I called thee to curse my enemies , and thou on the contrary hast blessed them three times .
Return to thy place .
I had determined indeed greatly to honour thee , but the Lord hath deprived thee of the honour designed for thee .
Balaam made answer to Balac : Did I not say to thy messengers , whom thou <unk> to me :
If Balac would give me his house full of silver and gold , I cannot go beyond the word of the Lord my God , to utter any thing of my own head either good or evil : but whatsoever the Lord shall say , that I will speak ?
But yet going to my people , I will give thee counsel , what this people shall do to thy people in the latter days .
Therefore taking up his parable , again he said : Balaam the son of Beor hath said : The man whose eye is stopped up , hath said :
The <unk> of the words of God hath said , who knoweth the doctrine of the Highest , and seeth the visions of the Almighty , who falling hath his eyes opened :
I shall see him , but not now : I shall behold him , but not near .
A <unk> <unk> <unk> out of Jacob and a sceptre shall spring up from Israel : and shall strike the chiefs of Moab , and shall waste all the children of Seth
And he shall possess Idumea : the inheritance of Seir shall come to their enemies , but Israel shall do manfully .
Out of Jacob shall he come that shall rule , and shall destroy the remains of the city .
And when he saw Amalec , he took up his parable , and said : Amalec the beginning of nations , whose latter ends shall be destroyed .
He saw also the Cinite : and took up his parable , and said : Thy habitation indeed is strong : but though thou build thy nest in a rock ,
And thou be chosen of the stock of <unk> , how long shalt thou be able to continue ?
For <unk> shall take thee captive .
And taking up his parable , again he said : Alas , who shall live when God shall do these things ?
They shall come in <unk> from Italy , they shall overcome the Assyrians , and shall waste the Hebrews , and at the last they themselves also shall perish .
And Balaam rose , and returned to his place : Balac also returned the way that he came .
Numbers Chapter 25 The people fall into fornication and idolatry ; for which <unk> thousand are slain .
The zeal of Phinees .
And Israel at that time abode in <unk> , and the people committed fornication with the daughters of Moab , 25 : 2 . Who called them to their sacrifices .
And they ate of them , and adored their gods .
And Israel was <unk> to Beelphegor : upon which the Lord being angry , <unk> to Beelphegor .... That is , they took to the worship of Beelphegor , an <unk> idol of the Moabites , and were consecrated , as it were , to him .
Said to Moses : Take all the princes of the people , and hang them up on <unk> against the sun : that my fury may be turned away from Israel .
And Moses said to the judges of Israel : Let every man kill his neighbours , that have been <unk> to Beelphegor .
And behold one of the children of Israel went in before his brethren to a harlot of Madian , in the sight of Moses and of all the children of Israel , who were weeping before the door of the tabernacle .
And when Phinees the son of Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest saw it , he rose up from the midst of the multitude , and taking a <unk> ,
<unk> in after the <unk> into the <unk> house , and thrust both of them through together , to wit , the man and the woman in the <unk> parts .
And the scourge ceased from the children of Israel .
And there were slain four and twenty thousand men .
And the Lord said to Moses :
Phinees the son of Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest , hath turned away my wrath from the children of Israel : because he was moved with my zeal against them , that I myself might not destroy the children of Israel in my zeal .
Therefore say to him : behold I give him the peace of my covenant ,
And the covenant of the priesthood for ever shall be both to him and his seed , because he hath been zealous for his God , and hath made atonement for the wickedness of the children of Israel .
And the name of the <unk> , that was slain with the woman of Madian , was Zambri the son of <unk> , a prince of the kindred and tribe of Simeon .
And the <unk> woman , that was slain with him , was called <unk> the daughter of Sur , a most noble prince among the Madianites .
And the Lord spoke to Moses , saying :
Let the Madianites find you their enemies , and slay you them :
Because they also have acted like enemies against you , and have <unk> deceived you by the idol <unk> , and <unk> their sister , a daughter of a prince of Madian , who was slain in the day of the plague for the <unk> of <unk> .

This is the sum of the children of Israel , that were reckoned up , six hundred and one thousand seven hundred and thirty .
And the Lord spoke to Moses , saying :
To these shall the land be divided for their possessions according to the number of names .
To the greater number thou shalt give a greater portion , and to the <unk> a less : to every one , as they have now been reckoned up , shall a possession be delivered :
Yet so that by lot the land be divided to the tribe and families .
Whatsoever shall fall by lot , that shall be taken by the more , or the <unk> .
This also is the number of the sons of Levi by their families : Gerson , of whom is the family of the <unk> : Caath , of whom is the family of the <unk> : Merari , of whom is the family of the <unk> .

Of Aaron were born Nadab and Abiu , and Eleazar and Ithamar :
Of whom Nadab and Abiu died , when they had offered the strange fire before the Lord .
And all that were numbered , were twenty-three thousand males from one month old and upward : for they were not reckoned up among the children of Israel , neither was a possession given to them with the rest .
This is the number of the children of Israel , that were <unk> by Moses and Eleazar the priest , in the plains of Moab upon the Jordan , over against Jericho .
<unk> whom there was not one of them that were numbered before by Moses and Aaron in the desert of Sinai .
For the Lord had foretold that they should die in the wilderness .
And none remained of them , but Caleb the son of Jephone , and Josue the son of Nun .

Josue is appointed to succeed Moses .
Then came the daughters of <unk> , the son of <unk> , the son of Galaad , the son of Machir , the son of Manasses , who was the son of Joseph : and their names are <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> , and Melcha , and Thersa .
And they stood before Moses and Eleazar the priest , and all the princes of the people at the door of the tabernacle of the covenant , and said :
Our father died in the desert , and was not in the sedition , that was raised against the Lord under Core , but he died in his own sin : and he had no male children .
Why is his name taken away out of his family , because he had no son ?
Give us a possession among the kinsmen of our father .
And Moses <unk> their cause to the judgment of the Lord .
And the Lord said to him :
The daughters of <unk> demand a just thing : Give them a possession among their father ’ s kindred , and let them succeed him in his inheritance .
And to the children of Israel thou shalt speak these things :
When a man dieth without a son , his inheritance shall pass to his daughter .
If he have no daughter , his brethren shall succeed him .
And if he have no brethren , you shall give the inheritance to his father ’ s brethren .
But if he have no <unk> by the father , the inheritance shall be given to them that are the next <unk> .
And this shall be to the children of Israel sacred by a perpetual law , as the Lord hath commanded Moses .
The Lord also said to Moses : Go up into this mountain <unk> , and view from thence the land which I will give to the children of Israel .
And when thou shalt have seen it , thou also shalt go to thy people , as thy brother Aaron is gone :
Because you offended me in the desert of Sin in the contradiction of the multitude , neither would you sanctify me before them at the waters .
These are the waters of contradiction in Cades of the desert of Sin .
And Moses answered him :
May the Lord the God of the spirits of all flesh provide a man , that may be over this multitude :
And may go out and in before them , and may lead them out , or bring them in : lest the people of the Lord be as sheep without a shepherd .
And the Lord said to him : take Josue the son of Nun , a man in whom is the Spirit , and put thy hand upon him .
And he shall stand before Eleazar the priest and all the multitude :
And thou shalt give him precepts in the sight of all , and part of thy glory , that all the congregation of the children of Israel may hear him .
If any thing be to be done , Eleazar the priest shall consult the Lord for him .
He and all the children of Israel with him , and the rest of the multitude shall go out and go in at his word .
Moses did as the Lord had commanded .
And , when he had taken Josue , he set him before Eleazar the priest , and all the assembly of the people ,
And laying his hands on his head , he repeated all things that the Lord had commanded .
Numbers Chapter 28 <unk> are appointed as well for every day as for sabbaths , and other festivals .
The Lord also said to Moses :
Command the children of Israel , and thou shalt say to them : <unk> ye my oblation and my bread , and burnt sacrifice of most sweet odour , in their due <unk> .
These are the sacrifices which you shall offer : Two lambs of a year old without blemish every day for the perpetual holocaust :

And these shall be the libations of wine that are to be poured out for every victim : <unk> a hin for every calf , a third for a ram , and a fourth for a lamb .
This shall be the holocaust for every month , as they succeed one another in the course of the year .
A buck goat also shall be offered to the Lord for a sin offering over and above the perpetual holocaust with its libations .
And in the first month , on the fourteenth day of the month , shall be the phase of the Lord ,

And the tenth of a tenth , to every lamb , that is to say , to all the seven lambs :
And one buck goat for sin , to make atonement for you ,
Besides the morning holocaust which you shall always offer .
So shall you do every day of the seven days for the food of the fire , and for a most sweet odour to the Lord , which shall rise from the holocaust , and from the libations of each .

Numbers Chapter 30 Of vows and <unk> : and their <unk> .
And Moses told the children of Israel all that the Lord had commanded him :
And he said to the princes of the tribes of the children of Israel : This is the word that the Lord hath commanded :
If any man make a vow to the Lord , or bind himself by an oath : he shall not make his word void but shall fulfil all that he promised .
If a woman vow any thing , and bind herself by an oath , being in her father ’ s house , and but yet a <unk> in age : if her father knew the vow that she hath promised , and the oath wherewith she hath bound her soul , and held his peace , she shall be bound by the vow :
Whatsoever she promised and swore , she shall fulfil in deed .
But if her father , immediately as soon as he heard it , <unk> it , both her vows and her <unk> shall be void , neither shall she be bound to what she promised , because her father hath <unk> it .
If she have a husband , and shall vow any thing , and the word once going out of her mouth shall bind her soul by an oath ,
The day that her husband shall hear it , and not <unk> it , she shall be bound to the vow , and shall give whatsoever she promised .
But if as soon as he heareth he <unk> it , and make her promises and the words wherewith she had bound her soul of no effect : the Lord will forgive her .
The widow , and she that is <unk> , shall fulfil whatsoever they vow .
If the wife in the house of her husband , hath bound herself by vow and by oath ,
If her husband hear , and hold his peace , and doth not <unk> the promise , she shall accomplish whatsoever she had promised .
But if forthwith he <unk> it , she shall not be bound by the promise : because her husband <unk> it , and the Lord will be merciful to her .
If she vow and bind herself by oath , to afflict her soul by fasting , or <unk> from other things , it shall <unk> on the will of her husband , whether she shall do it , or not do it .
But if the husband hearing it hold his peace , and <unk> the <unk> his mind till another day : whatsoever she had vowed and promised , she shall fulfil : because immediately as he heard it , he held his peace .
But if he <unk> it after that he knew it , he shall bear her iniquity .
These are the laws which the Lord appointed to Moses between the husband and the wife , between the father and the daughter that is as yet but a <unk> in age , or that abideth in her father ’ s house .
Numbers Chapter 31 The Madianites are slain for having drawn the people of Israel into sin .
The <unk> of the booty .
And the Lord spoke to Moses , saying :
<unk> first the children of Israel on the Madianites , and so thou shalt be gathered to thy people .
And Moses forthwith said : <unk> of you men to fight , who may take the revenge of the Lord on the Madianites .
Let a thousand men be chosen out of every tribe of Israel to be sent to the war .
And they gave a thousand of every tribe , that is to say , twelve thousand men well appointed for battle .
And Moses sent them with Phinees the son of Eleazar the priest , and he delivered to him the holy vessels , and the trumpets to sound .
And when they had fought against the Madianites and had overcome them , they slew all the men .
And their kings <unk> , and <unk> , and Sur , and Hur , and <unk> , five princes of the nation : Balaam also the son of Beor they killed with the sword .
And they took their women , and their children captives , and all their cattle , and all their goods : and all their possessions they <unk> :
And all their cities , and their villages , and <unk> , they burned .
And they carried away the booty , and all that they had taken both of men and of beasts .
And they brought them to Moses , and Eleazar the priest , and to all the multitude of the children of Israel .
But the rest of the things for use they carried to the camp on the plains of Moab , beside the Jordan over against Jericho .
And Moses and Eleazar the priest and all the princes of the synagogue went forth to meet them without the camp .
And Moses being angry with the chief officers of the army , the tribunes , and the centurions that were come from the battle ,
Said : Why have you saved the women ?
Are not these they , that deceived the children of Israel by the counsel of Balaam , and made you transgress against the Lord by the sin of <unk> , for which also the people was punished ?
The sin of <unk> ....
The sin committed in the worship of Beelphegor .
Therefore kill all that are of the male sex , even of the children : and put to death the women , that have <unk> known men .
Of children .... <unk> and children , <unk> speaking , were not to be killed in war , Deut .
<unk> .
But the great Lord of life and death was pleased to order it otherwise in the present case , in <unk> of the wickedness of this people , who by the counsel of Balaam , had sent their women among the Israelites on purpose to draw them from God .
But the <unk> , and all the women that are virgins save for yourselves :
And stay without the camp seven days .
He that hath killed a man , or touched one that is killed , shall be purified the third day and the seventh day .
And of all the spoil , every garment , or vessel , or any thing made for use , of the skins , or hair of goats , or of wood , shall be purified .
Eleazar also the priest spoke to the men of the army , that had fought , in this manner : This is the ordinance of the law , which the Lord hath commanded Moses :
<unk> , and silver , and brass , and iron , and lead , and <unk> ,
And all that may pass through the fire , shall be purified by fire , but whatsoever cannot abide the fire , shall be sanctified with the water of expiation :
And you shall wash your garments the seventh day , and being purified , you shall afterwards enter into the camp .
And the Lord said to Moses :
Take the sum of the things that were taken both of man and beast , thou and Eleazar the priest and the princes of the multitude :
And thou shalt divide the spoil equally , between them that fought and went out to the war , and between the rest of the multitude .
And thou shalt separate a portion to the Lord from them that fought and were in the battle , one soul of five hundred as well of persons as of oxen and asses and sheep .
And thou shalt give it to Eleazar the priest , because they are the firstfruits of the Lord .
Out of the <unk> also of the children of Israel thou shalt take the <unk> head of persons , and of oxen , and asses , and sheep , and of all beasts , and thou shalt give them to the Levites that watch in the charge of the tabernacle of the Lord .
And Moses and Eleazar did as the Lord had commanded .
And the spoil which the army had taken , was six hundred <unk> thousand sheep ,
<unk> thousand oxen ,
<unk> thousand asses :
And thirty-two thousand persons of the female sex , that had not known men .
And one half was given to them that had been in the battle , to wit , three hundred <unk> thousand five hundred sheep :
Out of which , for the portion of the Lord , were reckoned six hundred seventy five sheep .
And out of the <unk> thousand oxen , seventy-two oxen :
Out of the thirty thousand five hundred asses , <unk> asses :
Out of the sixteen thousand persons , there fell to the portion of the Lord , thirty-two souls .
And Moses delivered the number of the firstfruits of the Lord to Eleazar the priest , as had been commanded him ,
Out of the half of the children of Israel , which he had separated for them that had been in the battle .
But out of the half that fell to the rest of the multitude , that is to say , out of the three hundred <unk> thousand five hundred sheep ,
And out of the <unk> thousand oxen ,
And out of the thirty thousand five hundred asses ,
And out of the sixteen thousand persons ,
Moses took the <unk> head , and gave it to the Levites that watched in the tabernacle of the Lord , as the Lord had commanded .
And when the <unk> of the army , and the tribunes and centurions were come to Moses , they said :
We thy servants have reckoned up the number of the fighting men , whom we had under our hand , and not so much as one was wanting .
Therefore we offer as gifts to the Lord what gold every one of us could find in the booty , in <unk> and <unk> , rings and <unk> , and chains , that thou mayst pray to the Lord for us .
And Moses and Eleazar the priest received all the gold in divers kinds ,
In weight sixteen thousand seven hundred and fifty sicles , from the tribunes and from the centurions .
For that which every one had taken in the booty was his own .
And that which was received they brought into the tabernacle of the testimony , for a memorial of the children of Israel before the Lord .
Numbers Chapter 32 The tribes of Ruben and Gad , and half of the tribe of Manasses , receive their inheritance on the east side of Jordan , upon <unk> approved of by Moses .
And the sons of Ruben and Gad had many flocks of cattle , and their substance in beasts was infinite .
And when they saw the lands of Jazer and Galaad fit for feeding cattle ,
They came to Moses and Eleazar the priest , and the princes of the multitude , and said :
<unk> , and Dibon , and Jazer , and <unk> , Hesebon , and <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> ,
The land , which the Lord hath conquered in the sight of the children of Israel , is a very <unk> <unk> for the feeding of beasts : and we thy servants have very much cattle :
And we pray thee , if we have found favour in thy sight , that thou give it to us thy servants in possession , and make us not pass over the Jordan .
And Moses answered them : What , shall your brethren go to fight , and will you sit here ?
Why do ye <unk> the minds of the children of Israel , that they may not dare to pass into the place which the Lord hath given them ?
Was it not thus your fathers did , when I sent from Cadesbarne to view the land ?
And when they were come as far as the valley of the cluster , having viewed all the country , they <unk> the hearts of the children of Israel , that they should not enter into the coasts , which the Lord gave them .
And he swore in his anger , saying :
If these men , that came up out of Egypt , from twenty years old and upward , shall see the land , which I promised with an oath to Abraham , Isaac , and Jacob : because they would not follow me ,
Except Caleb the son of Jephone the <unk> , and Josue the son of Nun : these have fulfilled my will .
And the Lord being angry against Israel , led them about through the desert forty years , until the whole generation , that had done evil in his sight , was consumed .
And behold , said he , you are risen up instead of your fathers , the increase and offspring of sinful men , to <unk> the fury of the Lord against Israel .
For if you will not follow him , he will leave the people in the wilderness , and you shall be the cause of the destruction of all .
But they coming near , said : We will make <unk> , and <unk> for our cattle , and strong cities for our children :
And we ourselves will go armed and ready for battle before the children of Israel , until we bring them in unto their places .
Our little ones , and all we have , shall be in walled cities , for fear of the ambushes of the inhabitants .
We will not return into our houses until the children of Israel possess their inheritance :
Neither will we seek any thing beyond the Jordan , because we have already our possession on the east side thereof ,
And Moses said to them : If you do what you promise , go on well appointed for war before the Lord :
And let every fighting man pass over the Jordan , until the Lord overthrow his enemies :
And all the land be brought under him , then shall you be blameless before the Lord and before Israel , and you shall obtain the countries that you desire , before the Lord .
But if you do not what you say , no man can doubt but you sin against God : and know ye , that your sin shall overtake you .
<unk> therefore cities for your children , and <unk> and <unk> for your sheep and beasts , and accomplish what you have promised .
And the children of Gad and Ruben said to Moses : We are thy servants , we will do what my lord commandeth .
We will leave our children , and our wives and sheep and cattle , in the cities of Galaad :
And we thy servants all well appointed will march on to the war , as thou , my lord , speakest .
Moses therefore commanded Eleazar the priest , and Josue the son of Nun , and the princes of the families of all the tribes of Israel , and said to them :
If the children of Gad , and the children of Ruben pass with you over the Jordan , all armed for war before the Lord , and the land be made subject to you : give them Galaad in possession .
But if they will not pass armed with you into the land of Chanaan , let them receive places to dwell in among you .
And the children of Gad , and the children of Ruben answered : As the Lord hath spoken to his servants , so will we do :
We will go armed before the Lord into the land of Chanaan , and we confess that we have already received our possession beyond the Jordan .
Moses therefore gave to the children of Gad and of Ruben , and to the half tribe of Manasses the son of Joseph , the kingdom of Sehon king of the Amorrhites , and the kingdom of Og king of Basan , and their land and the cities thereof round about .
And the sons of Gad built Dibon , and <unk> , and Aroer ,
And <unk> , and <unk> , and Jazer , and <unk> ,
And <unk> , and <unk> , fenced cities , and <unk> for their cattle .
But the children of Ruben built Hesebon , and <unk> , and <unk> ,
And <unk> , and <unk> ( their names being changed ) and <unk> : giving names to the cities which they had built .
Moreover the children of Machir , the son of Manasses , went into Galaad , and wasted it , <unk> off the Amorrhites , the inhabitants thereof .
And Moses gave the land of Galaad to Machir the son of Manasses , and he dwelt in it .
And Jair the son of Manasses went , and took the villages thereof , and he called them <unk> Jair , that is to say , the villages of Jair .
Nobe also went , and took <unk> with the villages thereof : and he called it by his own name , Nobe .

These are the <unk> of the children of Israel , who went out of Egypt by their troops under the conduct of Moses and Aaron , The <unk> ....
These <unk> , or <unk> of the children of Israel from Egypt to the land of promise , were figures , according to the fathers , of the steps and degrees by which Christians leaving sin are to <unk> from virtue to virtue , till they come to the heavenly <unk> , after this life , to see and enjoy God .

Where the Lord said to Moses :
Command the children of Israel , and say to them : When you shall have passed over the Jordan , entering into the land of Chanaan ,
Destroy all the inhabitants of that land : <unk> down their pillars , and break in pieces their statues , and waste all their high places ,
<unk> the land , and dwelling in it .
For I have given it you for a possession .
And you shall divide it among you by lot .
To the more you shall give a <unk> part , and to the <unk> a lesser .
To every one as the lot shall fall , so shall the inheritance be given .
The possession shall be divided by the tribes and the families .
But if you will not kill the inhabitants of the land : they that remain , shall be unto you as nails in your eyes , and spears in your sides , and they shall be your adversaries in the land of your habitation .
And whatsoever I had thought to do to them , I will do to you .
Numbers Chapter 34 The limits of Chanaan ; with the names of the men that make the division of it .
And the Lord spoke to Moses , saying :
Command the children of Israel , and thou shalt say to them : When you are entered into the land of Chanaan , and it shall be fallen into your possession by lot , it shall be <unk> by these limits :
The south side shall begin from the wilderness of Sin , which is by Edom : and shall have the most salt sea for its <unk> limits eastward : The most salt sea ....
The lake of Sodom , otherwise called the <unk> Sea .
Which limits shall go round on the south side by the ascent of the <unk> and so into <unk> , and reach toward the south as far as Cadesbarne , from whence the <unk> shall go out to the town called Adar , and shall reach as far as <unk> .
The <unk> .... A mountain so called from having a great number of scorpions .
And the limits shall fetch a compass from <unk> to the torrent of Egypt , and shall end in the shore of the great sea .
The great sea ....
The <unk> .
And the west side shall begin from the great sea , and the same shall be the end thereof .
But toward the north side the borders shall begin from the great sea , <unk> to the most high mountain , The most high mountain .... Libanus .
From which they shall come to Emath , as far as the borders of <unk> :
And the limits shall go as far as <unk> , and the <unk> of Enan .
These shall be the borders on the north side .
From thence they shall mark out the bounds towards the east side from the <unk> of Enan unto <unk> .
And from <unk> the bounds shall go down to <unk> over against the fountain of <unk> : from thence they shall come eastward to the sea of <unk> , Sea of <unk> ....
This is the sea of Galilee , <unk> by the miracles of our Lord .
And shall reach as far as the Jordan , and at the last shall be closed in by the most salt sea .
This shall be your land with its borders round about .
And Moses commanded the children of Israel , saying : This shall be the land which you shall possess by lot , and which the Lord hath commanded to be given to the nine tribes , and to the half tribe .
For the tribe of the children of Ruben by their families , and the tribe of the children of Gad according to the number of their kindreds , and half of the tribe of Manasses ,
That is , two tribes and a half , have received their portion beyond the Jordan over against Jericho at the east side .
And the Lord said to Moses :
These are the names of the men , that shall divide the land unto you : Eleazar the priest , and Josue the son of Nun ,
And one prince of every tribe ,
Whose names are these : Of the tribe of Juda , Caleb the son of Jephone .
Of the tribe of Simeon , Samuel the son of Ammiud .
Of the tribe of Benjamin , <unk> the son of <unk> .
Of the tribe of the children of Dan , <unk> the son of <unk> .
Of the children of Joseph of the tribe of Manasses , <unk> the son of <unk> .
Of the tribe of Ephraim , <unk> the son of <unk> .
Of the tribe of Zabulon , <unk> the son of <unk> .
Of the tribe of Issachar , <unk> the prince , the son of <unk> .
Of the tribe of Aser , <unk> the son of <unk> .
Of the tribe of Nephtali : <unk> the son of Ammiud .
These are they Whom the Lord hath commanded to divide the land of Chanaan to the children of Israel .
Numbers Chapter 35 <unk> are appointed for the Levites .
Of which six are to be the cities of refuge .
And the Lord spoke these things also to Moses in the plains of Moab by the Jordan , over against Jericho :
Command the children of Israel that they give to the Levites out of their possessions ,
<unk> to dwell in , and their suburbs round about : that they may abide in the towns , and the suburbs may be for their cattle and beasts :
Which suburbs shall reach from the walls of the cities outward , a thousand <unk> on every side :
<unk> the east shall be two thousand cubits : and toward the south in like manner shall be two thousand cubits : toward the sea also , which looketh to the west , shall be the same <unk> : and the north side shall be <unk> with the like limits .
And the cities shall be in the midst , and the suburbs without .
And among the cities , which you shall give to the Levites , six shall be separated for refuge to fugitives , that he who hath shed blood may flee to them : and besides these there shall be other forty-two cities ,
That is , in all <unk> with their suburbs .
And of these cities which shall be given out of the possessions of the children of Israel , from them that have more , more shall be taken : and from them that have less , <unk> .
<unk> shall give towns to the Levites according to the <unk> of their inheritance .
The Lord said to Moses :
Speak to the children of Israel , and thou shalt say to them : When you shall have passed over the Jordan into the land of Chanaan ,
<unk> what cities shall be for the refuge of fugitives , who have shed blood against their will .
And when the fugitive shall be in them , the kinsman of him that is slain may not have power to kill him , until he stand before the multitude , and his cause be judged .
And of those cities , that are separated for the refuge of fugitives ,
Three shall be beyond the Jordan , and three in the land of Chanaan ,
As well for the children of Israel as for strangers and <unk> , that he may flee to them , who hath shed blood against his will .
If any man strike with iron , and he die that was struck : he shall be guilty of murder , and he himself shall die .
If he throw a stone , and he that is struck die : he shall be punished in the same manner .
If he that is struck with wood die : he shall be revenged by the blood of him that struck him .
The kinsman of him that was slain , shall kill the murderer : as soon as he <unk> him , he shall kill him .
If through hatred any one push a man , or <unk> any thing at him with ill design :
Or being his enemy , strike him with his hand , and he die : the <unk> shall be guilty of murder : the kinsman of him that was slain as soon as he findeth him , shall kill him .
But if by <unk> <unk> , and without hatred ,
And <unk> , he do any of these things ,
And this be proved in the hearing of the people , and the cause be <unk> between him that struck , and the next of <unk> :
The innocent shall be delivered from the hand of the <unk> , and shall be brought back by sentence into the city , to which he had fled , and he shall abide there until the death of the high priest , that is anointed with the holy oil .
Until the death , etc ....
This mystically signified that our deliverance was to be <unk> by the death of Christ , the high priest and the anointed of God .
If the murderer be found without the limits of the cities that are appointed for the <unk> ,
And be struck by him that is the <unk> of blood : he shall not be guilty that killed him .
For the fugitive ought to have stayed in the city until the death of the high priest : and after he is dead , then shall the <unk> return to his own country .
These things shall be perpetual , and for an ordinance in all your dwellings .
The murderer shall be punished by witnesses : none shall be condemned upon the <unk> of one man .
You shall not take money of him that is guilty of blood , but he shall die forthwith .
The <unk> and fugitives before the death of the high priest may by no means return into their own cities .
<unk> not the land of your habitation , which is <unk> with the blood of the innocent : neither can it otherwise be <unk> , but by his blood that hath shed the blood of another .
And thus shall your possession be cleansed , myself <unk> with you .
For I am the Lord that dwell among the children of Israel .
Numbers Chapter 36 That the <unk> may not be alienated from one tribe to another , all are to marry within their own tribes .
And the princes of the families of Galaad , the son of Machir , the son of Manasses , of the stock of the children of Joseph , came and spoke to Moses before the princes of Israel , and said :
The Lord hath commanded thee , my lord , that thou shouldst divide the land by lot to the children of Israel , and that thou shouldst give to the daughters of <unk> our brother the possession due to their father :
Now if men of another tribe take them to wives , their possession will follow them , and being <unk> to another tribe , will be a <unk> of our inheritance .
And so it shall come to pass , that when the jubilee , that is , the <unk> year of remission , is come , the distribution made by the lots shall be confounded , and the possession of the one shall pass to the others .
Moses answered the children of Israel , and said by the command of the Lord : The tribe of the children of Joseph hath spoken rightly .
And this is the law <unk> by the Lord touching the daughters of <unk> : Let them marry to whom they will , only so that it be to men of their own tribe .
Lest the possession of the children of Israel be mingled from tribe to tribe .
For all men shall marry wives of their own tribe and kindred :
And all women shall take husbands of the same tribe : that the inheritance may remain in the families .
And that the tribes be not mingled one with another , but remain so
As they were separated by the Lord .
And the daughters of <unk> did as was commanded :
And <unk> , and Thersa , and <unk> , and Melcha , and <unk> were married to the sons of their uncle by their father
Of the family of Manasses , who was the son of Joseph : and the possession that had been <unk> to them , remained in the tribe and family of their father .
These are the commandments and judgment , which the Lord commanded by the hand of Moses to the children of Israel , in the plains of Moab upon the Jordan over against Jericho .
THE BOOK OF <unk> This Book is called <unk> , which signifies a SECOND <unk> , because it <unk> and <unk> the ordinances formerly given on mount Sinai , with other precepts not expressed before .
The Hebrews , from the first words in the book , call it <unk> <unk> .
Deuteronomy Chapter 1 A <unk> of what passed at Sinai and Cadesbarne : and of the people ’ s murmuring and their punishment .
These are the words , which Moses spoke to all Israel beyond the Jordan , in the plain wilderness , over against the Red Sea , between Pharan and <unk> and Laban and <unk> , where there is very much gold .
<unk> days ’ journey from Horeb by the way of mount Seir to Cadesbarne .
In the <unk> year , the eleventh month , the first day of the month , Moses spoke to the children of Israel all that the Lord had commanded him to say to them :
After that he had slain Sehon king of the Amorrhites , who dwelt in Hesebon : and Og king of Basan who abode in Astaroth , and in <unk> ,
<unk> the Jordan in the land of Moab .
And Moses began to expound the law , and to say :
The Lord our God spoke to us in Horeb , saying : You have stayed long enough in this mountain :
Turn you , and come to the mountain of the Amorrhites , and to the other places that are next to it , the plains and the hills and the <unk> towards the south , and by the sea shore , the land of the Chanaanites , and of Libanus , as far as the great river Euphrates .
Behold , said he , I have delivered it to you : go in and possess it , concerning which the Lord swore to your fathers Abraham , Isaac , and Jacob , that he would give it to them , and to their seed after them .
And I said to you at that time :
I alone am not able to bear you : for the Lord your God hath multiplied you , and you are this day as the stars of heaven , for multitude .
( The Lord God of your fathers add to this number many thousands , and bless you as he hath spoken . )
I alone am not able to bear your business , and the charge of you and your <unk> .
Let me have from among you wise and understanding men , and such whose conversation is approved among your tribes , that I may appoint them your rulers .
Then you answered me : The thing is good which thou meanest to do .
And I took out of your tribes men wise and honourable , and appointed them rulers , tribunes , and centurions , and officers over <unk> , and over <unk> , who might teach you all things .
And I commanded them , saying : Hear them , and judge that which is just : whether he be one of your country , or a stranger .
There shall be no difference of persons , you shall hear the little as well as the great : neither shall you respect any man ’ s person , because it is the judgment of God .
And if any thing seem hard to you , <unk> it to me , and I will hear it .
And I commanded you all things that you were to do .
And departing from Horeb , we passed through the terrible and <unk> wilderness , which you saw , by the way of the mountain of the Amorrhite , as the Lord our God had commanded us .
And when we were come into Cadesbarne ,
I said to you : You are come to the mountain of the Amorrhite , which the Lord our God will give to us .
See the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee : go up and possess it , as the Lord our God hath spoken to thy fathers : fear not , nor be any way <unk> .
And you came all to me , and said : Let us send men who may view the land , and bring us word what way we shall go up , and to what cities we shall go .
And because the saying pleased me , I sent of you twelve men , one of every tribe : 1 : 24 . Who , when they had set forward and had gone up to the mountains , came as far as the valley of the cluster : and having viewed the land ,
<unk> of the fruits thereof , to shew its <unk> , they brought them to us , and said : The land is good , which the Lord our God will give us .
And you would not go up , but being incredulous to the word of the Lord our God ,
You murmured in your tents , and said : The Lord hateth us , and therefore he hath brought us out of the land of Egypt , that he might deliver us into the hand of the Amorrhite , and destroy us .
Whither shall we go up ?
the messengers have terrified our hearts , saying : The multitude is very great , and <unk> than we : the cities are great , and walled up to the sky , we have seen the sons of the <unk> there .
<unk> up to the sky .... A <unk> <unk> , signifying the walls to be very high .
And I said to you : Fear not , neither be ye afraid of them :
The Lord God , who is your leader , himself will fight for you , as he did in Egypt in the sight of all .
And in the wilderness ( as thou hast seen ) the Lord thy God hath carried thee , as a man is wont to carry his little son , all the way that you have come , until you came to this place .
And yet for all this you did not believe the Lord your God , 1 : 33 . Who went before you in the way , and <unk> out the place , wherein you should pitch your tents , in the night shewing you the way by fire , and in the day by the pillar of a cloud .
And when the Lord had heard the voice of your words , he was angry and swore , and said :
Not one of the men of this wicked generation shall see the good land , which I promised with an oath to your fathers :
Except Caleb the son of Jephone : for he shall see it , and to him I will give the land that he hath trodden upon , and to his children , because he hath followed the Lord .
Neither is his indignation against the people to be wondered at , since the Lord was angry with me also on your account , and said : Neither shalt thou go in thither .
But Josue the son of Nun , thy minister , he shall go in for thee : exhort and <unk> him , and he shall divide the land by lot to Israel .
Your children , of whom you said that they should be led away captives , and your sons who know not this day the difference of good and evil , they shall go in : and to them I will give the land , and they shall possess it .
But return you and go into the wilderness by the way of the Red Sea .
And you answered me : We have sinned against the Lord : we will go up and fight , as the Lord our God hath commanded .
And when you went ready armed unto the mountain ,
The Lord said to me : Say to them : Go not up , and fight not , for I am not with you : lest you fall before your enemies .
I spoke , and you hearkened not : but <unk> the commandment of the Lord , and swelling with pride , you went up into the mountain .
And the Amorrhite that dwelt in the mountains coming out , and <unk> you , <unk> you , as <unk> do : and made slaughter of you from Seir as far as <unk> .
And when you returned and wept before the Lord , he heard you not , neither would he yield to your voice .
So you abode in Cadesbarne a long time .
Deuteronomy Chapter 2 They are forbid to fight against the Edomites , Moabites , and Ammonites .
Their victory over Sehon king of Hesebon .
And departing from thence we came into the wilderness that leadeth to the Red Sea , as the Lord had spoken to me : and we compassed mount Seir a long time .
And the Lord said to me :
You have compassed this mountain long enough : go toward the north :
And command thou the people , saying : You shall pass by the borders of your brethren the children of Esau , who dwell in Seir , and they will be afraid of you .
Take ye then good heed that you stir not against them .
For I will not give you of their land so much as the step of one foot can tread upon , because I have given mount Seir to Esau , for a possession .
You shall buy meats of them for money and shall eat : you shall draw waters for money , and shall drink .
The Lord thy God hath blessed thee in every work of thy hands : the Lord thy God dwelling with thee , knoweth thy journey , how thou hast passed through this great wilderness , for forty years , and thou hast <unk> nothing .
And when we had passed by our brethren the children of Esau , that dwelt in Seir , by the way of the plain from <unk> and from <unk> , we came to the way that leadeth to the desert of Moab .
And the Lord said to me : <unk> not against the Moabites , neither go to battle against them : for I will not give thee any of their land , because I have given <unk> to the children of Lot in possession .
The <unk> first were the inhabitants thereof , a people great , and strong , and so tall , that like the race of the <unk> ,
They were esteemed as giants , and were like the sons of the <unk> .
But the Moabites call them <unk> .
The <unk> also formerly dwelt in Seir : who being driven out and destroyed , the children of Esau dwelt there , as Israel did in the land of his possession , which the Lord gave him .
Then rising up to pass the torrent <unk> , we came to it .
And the time that we <unk> from Cadesbarne till we passed over the torrent <unk> , was <unk> years : until all the generation of the men that were fit for war was consumed out of the camp , as the Lord had sworn :
For his hand was against them , that they should perish from the midst of the camp .
And after all the fighting men were dead ,
The Lord spoke to me , saying :
Thou shalt pass this day the borders of Moab , the city named <unk> :
And when thou comest nigh the <unk> of the children of Ammon , take heed thou fight not against them , nor once move to battle : for I will not give thee of the land of the children of Ammon , because I have given it to the children of Lot for a possession .
It was accounted a land of giants : and giants formerly dwelt in it , whom the Ammonites call <unk> ,
A people great and many , and of tall stature , like the <unk> whom the Lord destroyed before their face : and he made them to dwell in their stead ,
As he had done in favour of the children of Esau , that dwell in Seir , destroying the <unk> , and delivering their land to them , which they possess to this day .
The <unk> also , that dwelt in <unk> as far as Gaza , were <unk> by the <unk> : who came out of <unk> , and destroyed them and dwelt in their stead .
Arise ye , and pass the torrent Arnon : Behold I have delivered into thy hand Sehon king of Hesebon the Amorrhite , and begin thou to possess his land and make war against him .
This day will I begin to send the dread and fear of thee upon the nations that dwell under the whole heaven : that when they hear thy name they may fear and tremble , and be in pain like women in <unk> .
So I sent messengers from the wilderness of <unk> to Sehon the king of Hesebon with peaceable words , saying :
We will pass through thy land , we will go along by the <unk> : we will not turn aside neither to the right hand nor to the left .
<unk> us meat for money , that we may eat : give us water for money and so we will drink .
We only ask that thou wilt let us pass through ,
As the children of Esau have done , that dwell in Seir , and the Moabites , that abide in <unk> : until we come to the Jordan , and pass to the land which the Lord our God will give us .
And Sehon the king of Hesebon would not let us pass : because the Lord thy God had hardened his spirit , and fixed his heart , that he might be delivered into thy hands , as now thou seest .
<unk> , etc .... That is , in punishment of his past sins he left him to his own stubborn and perverse disposition , which drew him to his ruin .
See the note on Ex .
<unk> .
And the Lord said to me : Behold I have begun to deliver unto thee Sehon and his land , begin to possess it .
And Sehon came out to meet us with all his people to fight at <unk> .
And the Lord our God delivered him to us : and we slew him with his sons and all his people .
And we took all his cities at that time , killing the inhabitants of them , men and women and children .
We left nothing of them :
Except the cattle which came to the <unk> of them that took them : and the spoils of the cities , which we took :
From Aroer , which is upon the bank of the torrent Arnon , a town that is situate in a valley , as far as Galaad .
There was not a <unk> or city , that escaped our hands : the Lord our God delivered all unto us :
Except the land of the children of Ammon , to which we <unk> not : and all that border upon the torrent <unk> , and the cities in the mountains , and all the places which the Lord our God <unk> us .
Deuteronomy Chapter 3 The victory over Og king of Basan .
Ruben , Gad , and half the tribe of Manasses receive their possession on the other side of Jordan .
Then we turned and went by the way of Basan : and Og the king of Basan came out to meet us with his people to fight in <unk> .
And the Lord said to me : Fear him not : because he is delivered into thy hand , with all his people and his land : and thou shalt do to him as thou hast done to Sehon king of the Amorrhites , that dwelt in Hesebon .
So the Lord our God delivered into our hands , Og also , the king of Basan , and all his people : and we utterly destroyed them ,
<unk> all his cities at one time , there was not a town that escaped us : sixty cities , all the country of <unk> the kingdom of Og in Basan .
All the cities were fenced with very high walls , and with gates and bars , besides innumerable towns that had no walls .
And we utterly destroyed them , as we had done to Sehon the king of Hesebon , destroying every city , men and women and children :
But the cattle and the spoils of the cities we took for our prey .
And we took at that time the land out of the hand of the two kings of the Amorrhites , that were beyond the Jordan : from the torrent Arnon unto the mount Hermon ,
Which the Sidonians call <unk> , and the Amorrhites <unk> :
All the cities that are situate in the plain , and all the land of Galaad and Basan as far as <unk> and <unk> , cities of the kingdom of Og in Basan .
For only Og king of Basan remained of the race of the giants .
His bed of iron is shewn , which is in Rabbath of the children of Ammon , being nine cubits long , and four broad after the measure of the cubit of a man ’ s hand .
And we possessed the land at that time from Aroer , which is upon the bank of the torrent Arnon , unto the half of mount Galaad : and I gave the cities thereof to Ruben and Gad .
And I delivered the other part of Galaad , and all Basan the kingdom of Og to the half tribe of Manasses , all the country of <unk> : and all Basan is called the <unk> of giants .
Jair the son of Manasses possessed all the country of <unk> unto the borders of <unk> , and <unk> .
And he called Basan by his own name , <unk> Jair , that is to say , the towns of Jair , until this present day .
To Machir also I gave Galaad .
And to the tribes of Ruben and Gad I gave of the land of Galaad as far as the torrent Arnon , half the torrent , and the confines even unto the torrent <unk> , which is the border of the children of Ammon :
And the plain of the wilderness , and the Jordan , and the borders of <unk> unto the sea of the desert , which is the most salt sea , to the foot of mount <unk> eastward .
And I commanded you at that time , saying : The Lord your God giveth you this land for an inheritance , go ye well appointed before your brethren the children of Israel , all the strong men of you .
<unk> your wives and children and cattle .
For I know you have much cattle , and they must remain in the cities , which I have delivered to you .
Until the Lord give rest to your brethren , as he hath given to you : and they also possess the land , which he will give them beyond the Jordan : then shall every man return to his possession , which I have given you .
I commanded Josue also at that time , saying : Thy eyes have seen what the Lord your God hath done to these two kings : so will he do to all the kingdoms to which thou shalt pass .
Fear them not : for the Lord your God will fight for you .
And I besought the Lord at that time , saying :
Lord God , thou hast begun to shew unto thy servant thy greatness , and most mighty hand , for there is no other God either in heaven or earth , that is able to do thy works , or to be compared to thy strength .
I will pass over therefore , and will see this excellent land beyond the Jordan , and this goodly mountain , and Libanus .
And the Lord was angry with me on your account and heard me not , but said to me : It is enough : speak no more to me of this matter .
Go up to the top of <unk> , and cast thy eyes round about to the west , and to the north , and to the south , and to the east , and behold it , for thou shalt not pass this Jordan .
Command Josue , and <unk> and strengthen him : for he shall go before this people , and shall divide unto them the land which thou shalt see .
And we abode in the valley over against the temple of <unk> .
Deuteronomy Chapter 4 Moses <unk> the people to keep God ’ s commandments : particularly to fly idolatry .
<unk> three cities of refuge , on that side of the Jordan .
And now , O Israel , hear the commandments and judgments which I teach thee : that doing them , thou mayst live , and entering in mayst possess the land which the Lord the God of your fathers will give you .
You shall not add to the word that I speak to you , neither shall you take away from it : keep the commandments of the Lord your God which I command you .
Your eyes have seen all that the Lord hath done against Beelphegor , how he hath destroyed all his <unk> from among you .
But you that <unk> to the Lord your God , are all alive until this present day .
You know that I have taught you statutes and justices , as the Lord my God hath commanded me : so shall you do them in the land which you shall possess :
And you shall observe , and fulfil them in practice .
For this is your wisdom , and understanding in the sight of nations , that hearing all these precepts , they may say : Behold a wise and understanding people , a great nation .
Neither is there any other nation so great , that hath gods so nigh them , as our God is present to all our <unk> .
For what other nation is there so renowned that hath ceremonies , and just judgments , and all the law , which I will set forth this day before our eyes ?
Keep thyself therefore , and thy soul carefully .
<unk> not the words that thy eyes have seen , and let them not go out of thy heart all the days of thy life .
Thou shalt teach them to thy sons and to thy grandsons ,
From the day in which thou didst stand before the Lord thy God in Horeb , when the Lord spoke to me , saying : Call together the people unto me , that they may hear my words , and may learn to fear me all the time that they live on the earth , and may teach their children .
And you came to the foot of the mount , which burned even unto heaven : and there was darkness , and a cloud and <unk> in it .
And the Lord spoke to you from the midst of the fire .
You heard the voice of his words , but you saw not any form at all .
And he shewed you his covenant , which he commanded you to do , and the ten words that he wrote in two tables of stone .
And he commanded me at that time that I should teach you the ceremonies and judgments which you shall do in the land , that you shall possess .
Keep therefore your souls carefully .
You saw not any similitude in the day that the Lord God spoke to you in Horeb from the midst of the fire :
Lest perhaps being deceived you might make you a graven similitude , or image of male or female ,
The similitude of any beasts , that are upon the earth , or of birds , that fly under heaven ,
Or of creeping things , that move on the earth , or of fishes , that abide in the waters under the earth :
Lest perhaps lifting up thy eyes to heaven , thou see the sun and the moon , and all the stars of heaven , and being deceived by error thou adore and serve them , which the Lord thy God created for the service of all the nations , that are under heaven .
But the Lord hath taken you and brought you out of the iron <unk> of Egypt , to make you his people of inheritance , as it is this present day .
And the Lord was angry with me for your words , and he swore that I should not pass over the Jordan , nor enter into the excellent land , which he will give you .
Behold I die in this land , I shall not pass over the Jordan : you shall pass , and possess the goodly land .
Beware lest thou ever forget the covenant of the Lord thy God , which he hath made with thee : and make to thyself a graven likeness of those things which the Lord hath forbid to be made :
Because the Lord thy God is a <unk> fire , a jealous God .
If you shall beget sons and grandsons , and abide in the land , and being deceived , make to yourselves any similitude , <unk> evil before the Lord your God , to provoke him to wrath :
I call this day heaven and earth to witness , that you shall quickly perish out of the land , which , when you have passed over the Jordan , you shall possess .
You shall not dwell therein long , but the Lord will destroy you ,
And scatter you among all nations , and you shall remain a few among the nations , to which the Lord shall lead you .
And there you shall serve gods , that were framed with men ’ s hands : wood and stone , that neither see , nor hear , nor eat , nor smell .
And when thou shalt seek there the Lord thy God , thou shalt find him : yet so , if thou seek him with all thy heart , and all the affliction of thy soul .
After all the things aforesaid shall find thee , in the latter time thou shalt return to the Lord thy God , and shalt hear his voice .
Because the Lord thy God is a merciful God : he will not leave thee , nor altogether destroy thee , nor forget the covenant , by which he swore to thy fathers .
Ask of the days of old , that have been before thy time from the day that God created man upon the earth , from one end of heaven to the other end thereof , if ever there was done the like thing , or it hath been known at any time ,
That a people should hear the voice of God speaking out of the midst of fire , as thou hast heard , and lived :
If God ever did so as to go , and take to himself a nation out of the midst of nations by temptations , signs , and wonders , by fight , and a strong hand , and stretched out arm , and horrible visions according to all the things that the Lord your God did for you in Egypt , before thy eyes .
That thou mightest know that the Lord he is God , and there is no other besides him .
From heaven he made thee to hear his voice , that he might teach thee .
And upon earth he shewed thee his exceeding great fire , and thou didst hear his words out of the midst of the fire ,
Because he loved thy fathers , and chose their seed after them .
And he brought thee out of Egypt , going before thee with his great power ,
To destroy at thy coming very great nations , and stronger than thou art , and to bring thee in , and give thee their land for a possession , as thou seest at this present day .
Know therefore this day , and think in thy heart that the Lord he is God in heaven above , and in the earth beneath , and there is no other .
Keep his precepts and commandments , which I command thee : that it may be well with thee , and thy children after thee , and thou mayst remain a long time upon the land , which the Lord thy God will give thee .
Then Moses set aside three cities beyond the Jordan at the east side ,
That any one might flee to them who should kill his neighbour <unk> , and was not his enemy a day or two before , and that he might escape to some one of these cities :
Bosor in the wilderness , which is situate in the plains of the tribe of Ruben : and Ramoth in Galaad , which is in the tribe of Gad : and <unk> in Basan , which is in the tribe of Manasses .
This is the law , that Moses set before the children of Israel ,
And these are the testimonies and ceremonies and judgments , which he spoke to the children of Israel , when they came out of Egypt ,
<unk> the Jordan in the valley over against the temple of <unk> , in the land of Sehon king of the Amorrhites , that dwelt in Hesebon , whom Moses slew .
And the children of Israel coming out of Egypt ,
<unk> his land , and the land of Og king of Basan , of the two kings of the Amorrhites , who were beyond the Jordan towards the rising of the sun :
From Aroer , which is situate upon the bank of the torrent Arnon , unto mount Sion , which is also called Hermon ,
All the plain beyond the Jordan at the east side , unto the sea of the wilderness , and unto the foot of mount <unk> .
Deuteronomy Chapter 5 The ten commandments are repeated and <unk> .
And Moses called all Israel , and said to them : Hear , O Israel , the ceremonies and judgments , which I speak in your ears this day : learn them , and fulfil them in work .
The Lord our God made a covenant with us in Horeb .
He made not the covenant with our fathers , but with us , who are now present and living .
He spoke to us face to face in the mount out of the midst of fire .
I was the mediator and stood between the Lord and you at that time , to shew you his words , for you feared the fire , and went not up into the mountain , and he said :
I am the Lord thy God , who brought thee out of the land of Egypt , out of the house of bondage .
Thou shalt not have strange gods in my sight .
Thou shalt not make to thy self a graven thing , nor the likeness of any things , that are in heaven above , or that are in the earth beneath , or that abide in the waters under the earth .
Thou shalt not adore them , and thou shalt not serve them .
For I am the Lord thy God , a jealous God , <unk> the iniquity of the fathers upon their children unto the third and fourth generation , to them that hate me ,
And shewing mercy unto many thousands , to them that love me , and keep my commandments .
Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain : for he shall not be unpunished that taketh his name upon a vain thing .
<unk> the day of the sabbath , to sanctify it , as the Lord thy God hath commanded thee .
Six days shalt thou labour , and shalt do all thy works .
The seventh is the day of the sabbath , that is , the rest of the Lord thy God .
Thou shalt not do any work therein , thou nor thy son nor thy daughter , nor thy manservant nor thy maidservant , nor thy ox , nor thy ass , nor any of thy beasts , nor the stranger that is within thy gates : that thy manservant and thy maidservant may rest , even as thyself .
Remember that thou also didst serve in Egypt , and the Lord thy God brought thee out from thence with a strong hand , and a stretched out arm .
Therefore hath he commanded thee that thou shouldst observe the sabbath day .
Honour thy father and mother , as the Lord thy God hath commanded thee , that thou mayst live a long time , and it may be well with thee in the land , which the Lord thy God will give thee .
Thou shalt not kill .
Neither shalt thou commit adultery .
And thou shalt not steal .
Neither shalt thou bear false witness against thy neighbour .
Thou shalt not covet thy neighbour ’ s wife : nor his house , nor his field , nor his manservant , nor his maidservant , nor his ox , nor his ass , nor any thing that is his .
These words the Lord spoke to all the multitude of you in the mountain , out of the midst of the fire and the cloud , and the darkness , with a loud voice , <unk> nothing more : and he wrote them in two tables of stone , which he delivered unto me .
But you , after you heard the voice out of the midst of the darkness , and saw the mountain burn , came to me , all the princes of the tribes and the elders , and you said :
Behold the Lord our God hath shewn us his majesty and his greatness , we have heard his voice out of the midst of the fire , and have proved this day that God speaking with man , man hath lived .
Why shall we die therefore , and why shall this exceeding great fire <unk> us : for if we hear the voice of the Lord our God any more , we shall die .
What is all flesh , that it should hear the voice of the living God , who speaketh out of the midst of the fire , as we have heard , and be able to live ?
<unk> thou rather : and hear all things that the Lord our God shall say to thee , and thou shalt speak to us , and we will hear and will do them .
And when the Lord had heard this , he said to me : I have heard the voice of the words of this people , which they spoke to thee : they have spoken all things well .
5 : 29 . Who shall give them to have such a mind , to fear me , and to keep all my commandments at all times , that it may be well with them and with their children for ever ?
Go and say to them : Return into your tents .
But stand thou here with me , and I will speak to thee all my commandments , and ceremonies and judgments : which thou shalt teach them , that they may do them in the land , which I will give them for a possession .
Keep therefore and do the things which the Lord God hath commanded you : you shall not go aside neither to the right hand , nor to the left .
But you shall walk in the way that the Lord your God hath commanded , that you may live , and it may be well with you , and your days may be long in the land of your possession .
Deuteronomy Chapter 6 An exhortation to the love of God , and obedience to his law .
These are the precepts , and ceremonies , and judgments , which the Lord your God commanded that I should teach you , and that you should do them in the land into which you pass over to possess it :
That thou mayst fear the Lord thy God , and keep all his commandments and precepts , which I command thee , and thy sons , and thy grandsons , all the days of thy life , that thy days may be <unk> .
Hear , O Israel , and observe to do the things which the Lord hath commanded thee , that it may be well with thee , and thou mayst be greatly multiplied , as the Lord the God of thy fathers hath promised thee a land flowing with milk and honey .
Hear , O Israel , the Lord our God is one Lord .
Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with thy whole heart , and with thy whole soul , and with thy whole strength .
And these words which I command thee this day , shall be in thy heart :
And thou shalt tell them to thy children , and thou shalt meditate upon them sitting in thy house , and walking on thy journey , sleeping and rising .
And thou shalt bind them as a sign on thy hand , and they shall be and shall move between thy eyes .
And thou shalt write them in the entry , and on the doors of thy house .
And when the Lord thy God shall have brought thee into the land , for which he swore to thy fathers Abraham , Isaac , and Jacob : and shall have given thee great and goodly cities , which thou didst not build ,
<unk> full of riches , which thou didst not set up , <unk> which thou didst not dig , vineyards and <unk> , which thou didst not plant ,
And thou shalt have eaten and be full :
Take heed diligently lest thou forget the Lord , who brought thee out of the land of Egypt , out of the house of bondage .
Thou shalt fear the Lord thy God , and shalt serve him only , and thou shalt swear by his name .
You shall not go after the strange gods of all the nations , that are round about you :
Because the Lord thy God is a jealous God in the midst of thee : lest at any time the wrath of the Lord thy God be kindled against thee , and take thee away from the face of the earth .
Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God , as thou <unk> him in the place of temptation .
Keep the precepts of the Lord thy God , and the testimonies and ceremonies which he hath commanded thee .
And do that which is pleasing and good in the sight of the Lord , that it may be well with thee : and going in thou mayst possess the goodly land , concerning which the Lord swore to thy fathers ,
That he would destroy all thy enemies before thee , as he hath spoken .
And when thy son shall ask thee to morrow , saying : What mean these testimonies , and ceremonies and judgments , which the Lord our God hath commanded us ?
Thou shalt say to him : We were bondmen of Pharao in Egypt , and the Lord brought us out of Egypt with a strong hand .
And he wrought signs and wonders great and very grievous in Egypt against Pharao , and all his house , in our sight ,
And he brought us out from thence , that he might bring us in and give us the land , concerning which he swore to our fathers .
And the Lord commanded that we should do all these ordinances , and should fear the Lord our God , that it might be well with us all the days of our life , as it is at this day .
And he will be merciful to us , if we keep and do all his precepts before the Lord our God , as he hath commanded us .
Deuteronomy Chapter 7 No league nor fellowship to be made with the Chanaanites : God promiseth his people his blessing and assistance , if they keep his commandments .
When the Lord thy God shall have brought thee into the land , which thou art going in to possess , and shall have destroyed many nations before thee , the Hethite , and the <unk> , and the Amorrhite , and the Chanaanite , and the Pherezite , and the Hevite , and the Jebusite , seven nations much more numerous than thou art , and stronger than thou :
And the Lord thy God shall have delivered them to thee , thou shalt utterly destroy them .
Thou shalt make no league with them , nor shew mercy to them :
Neither shalt thou make <unk> with them .
Thou shalt not give thy daughter to his son , nor take his daughter for thy son :
For she will turn away thy son from following me , that he may rather serve strange gods , and the wrath of the Lord will be kindled , and will quickly destroy thee .
But thus rather shall you deal with them : Destroy their altars , and break their statues , and cut down their groves , and burn their graven things .
Because thou art a holy people to the Lord thy God .
The Lord thy God hath chosen thee , to be his peculiar people of all peoples that are upon the earth .
Not because you <unk> all nations in number , is the Lord joined unto you , and hath chosen you , for you are the <unk> of any people :
But because the Lord hath loved you , and hath kept his oath , which he swore to your fathers : and hath brought you out with a strong hand , and redeemed you from the house of bondage , out of the hand of Pharao the king of Egypt .
And thou shalt know that the Lord thy God , he is a strong and faithful God , keeping his covenant and mercy to them that love him , and to them that keep his commandments , unto a thousand generations :
And <unk> forthwith them that hate him , so as to destroy them , without further delay immediately rendering to them what they deserve .
Keep therefore the precepts and ceremonies and judgments , which I command thee this day to do .
If after thou hast heard these judgments , thou keep and do them , the Lord thy God will also keep his covenant to thee , and the mercy which he swore to thy fathers :
And he will love thee and multiply thee , and will bless the fruit of thy womb , and the fruit of thy land , thy corn , and thy vintage , thy oil , and thy herds , and the flocks of thy sheep upon the land , for which he swore to thy fathers that he would give it thee .
Blessed shalt thou be among all people .
No one shall be barren among you of either sex , neither of men nor cattle .
The Lord will take away from thee all sickness : and the grievous infirmities of Egypt , which thou knowest , he will not bring upon thee , but upon thy enemies .
Thou shalt consume all the people , which the Lord thy God will deliver to thee .
Thy eye shall not spare them , neither shalt thou serve their gods , lest they be thy ruin .
If thou say in thy heart : These nations are more than I , how shall I be able to destroy them ?
Fear not , but remember what the Lord thy God did to Pharao and to all the Egyptians ,
The exceeding great plagues , which thy eyes saw , and the signs and wonders , and the strong hand , and the stretched out arm , with which the Lord thy God brought thee out : so will he do to all the people , whom thou <unk> .
Moreover the Lord thy God will send also <unk> among them , until he destroy and consume all that have escaped thee , and could hide themselves .
Thou shalt not fear them , because the Lord thy God is in the midst of thee , a God mighty and terrible :
He will consume these nations in thy sight by little and little and by degrees .
Thou wilt not be able to destroy them altogether : lest perhaps the beasts of the earth should increase upon thee .
But the Lord thy God shall deliver them in thy sight : and shall slay them until they be utterly destroyed .
And he shall deliver their kings into thy hands , and thou shalt destroy their names from under Heaven : no man shall be able to resist thee , until thou destroy them .
Their graven things thou shalt burn with fire : thou shalt not covet the silver and gold of which they are made , neither shalt thou take to thee any thing thereof , lest thou offend , because it is an abomination to the Lord thy God .
<unk> things .... <unk> , so called by contempt .
Neither shalt thou bring any thing of the idol into thy house , lest thou become an anathema , like it .
Thou shalt <unk> it as dung , and shalt utterly abhor it as uncleanness and filth , because it is an anathema .
Deuteronomy Chapter 8 The people is put in mind of God ’ s <unk> with them , to the end that they may love him and serve him .
All the commandments , that I command thee this day , take great care to observe : that you may live , and be multiplied , and going in may possess the land , for which the Lord swore to your fathers .
And thou shalt remember all the way through which the Lord thy God hath brought thee for forty years through the desert , to afflict thee and to prove thee , and that the things that were in thy heart might be made known , whether thou wouldst keep his commandments or no .
He afflicted thee with want , and gave thee manna for thy food , which neither thou nor thy fathers knew : to shew that not in bread alone doth man live , but in every word that proceedeth from the mouth of God .
Not in bread alone , etc .... That is , that God is able to make food of what he <unk> for the support of man .
Thy raiment , with which thou wast covered , hath not <unk> for age , and thy foot is not <unk> , lo this is the <unk> year ,
That thou mayst consider in thy heart , that as a man <unk> up his son , so the Lord thy God hath <unk> thee up .
That thou shouldst keep the commandments of the Lord thy God , and walk in his ways , and fear him .
For the Lord thy God will bring thee into a good land , of <unk> and of waters , and of fountains : in the plains of which and the hills deep rivers break out :
A land of wheat , and barley , and vineyards , wherein fig trees and pomegranates , and <unk> grow : a land of oil and honey .
Where without any want thou shalt eat thy bread , and enjoy abundance of all things : where the stones are iron , and out of its hills are dug <unk> of brass :
That when thou hast eaten , and art full , thou mayst bless the Lord thy God for the excellent land which he hath given thee .
Take heed , and beware lest at any time thou forget the Lord thy God , and neglect his commandments and judgments and ceremonies , which I command thee this day :
Lest after thou hast eaten and art filled , hast built goodly houses , and dwelt in them ,
And shalt have herds of oxen and flocks of sheep , and plenty of gold and of silver , and of all things ,
Thy heart be lifted up , and thou remember not the Lord thy God , who brought thee out of the land of Egypt , out of the house of bondage :
And was thy leader in the great and terrible wilderness , wherein there was the serpent burning with his breath , and the <unk> and the <unk> , and no waters at all : who brought forth streams out of the <unk> rock , The <unk> .... A serpent whose bite causeth a violent thirst ; from whence it has its name , for in Greek <unk> signifies thirst .
And fed thee in the wilderness with manna which thy fathers knew not .
And after he had afflicted and proved thee , at the last he had mercy on thee ,
Lest thou shouldst say in thy heart : My own might , and the strength of my own hand have <unk> all these things for me .
But remember the Lord thy God , that he hath given thee strength , that he might fulfil his covenant , concerning which he swore to thy fathers , as this present day sheweth .
But if thou forget the Lord thy God , and follow strange gods , and serve and adore them : behold now I <unk> thee that thou shalt utterly perish .
As the nations , which the Lord destroyed at thy entrance , so shall you also perish , if you be <unk> to the voice of the Lord your God .
Deuteronomy Chapter 9 Lest they should <unk> their victories to their own <unk> , they are put in mind of their manifold <unk> and other sins , for which they should have been destroyed , but God spared them for his promise made to Abraham , Isaac , and Jacob .
Hear , O Israel : Thou shalt go over the Jordan this day ; to possess nations very great , and stronger than thyself , cities great , and walled up to the sky ,
A people great and tall , the sons of the <unk> , whom thou hast seen , and heard of , against whom no man is able to stand .
Thou shalt know therefore this day that the Lord thy God himself will pass over before thee , a devouring and <unk> fire , to destroy and <unk> and bring them to nothing before thy face quickly , as he hath spoken to thee .
Say not in thy heart , when the Lord thy God shall have destroyed them in thy sight : For my justice hath the Lord brought me in to possess this land , whereas these nations are destroyed for their wickedness .
For it is not for thy justices , and the <unk> of thy heart that thou shalt go in to possess their lands : but because they have done wickedly , they are destroyed at thy coming in : and that the Lord might accomplish his word , which he promised by oath to thy fathers Abraham , Isaac , and Jacob .
Know therefore that the Lord thy God giveth thee not this excellent land in possession for thy justices , for thou art a very <unk> people .
Remember , and forget not how thou <unk> the Lord thy God to wrath in the wilderness .
From the day that thou camest out of Egypt unto this place , thou hast always <unk> against the Lord .
For in Horeb , also thou didst provoke him , and he was angry , and would have destroyed thee ,
When I went up into the mount to receive the tables of stone , the tables of the covenant which the Lord made with you : and I continued in the mount forty days and nights , neither eating bread , nor drinking water .
And the Lord gave me two tables of stone written with the finger of God , and <unk> all the words that he spoke to you in the mount from the midst of the fire , when the people were assembled together .
And when forty days were passed , and as many nights , the Lord gave me the two tables of stone , the tables of the covenant ,
And said to me : Arise , and go down from hence quickly : for thy people , which thou hast brought out of Egypt , have quickly forsaken the way that thou hast shewn them , and have made to themselves a molten idol .
And again the Lord said to me : I see that this people is <unk> :
Let me alone that I may destroy them , and <unk> their name from under heaven , and set thee over a nation , that is greater and stronger than this .
And when I came down from the burning mount , and held the two tables of the covenant with both hands ,
And saw that you had sinned against the Lord your God , and had made to yourselves a molten calf , and had quickly forsaken his way , which he had shewn you :
I cast the tables out of my hands , and broke them in your sight .
And I fell down before the Lord as before , forty days and nights neither eating bread , nor drinking water , for all your sins , which you had committed against the Lord , and had provoked him to wrath :
For I feared his indignation and anger , wherewith being moved against you , he would have destroyed you .
And the Lord heard me this time also .
And he was exceeding angry against Aaron also , and would have destroyed him , and I prayed in like manner for him .
And your sin that you had committed , that is , the calf , I took , and burned it with fire , and breaking it into pieces , until it was as small as dust , I threw it into the torrent , which cometh down from the mountain .
At the burning also , and at the place of temptation , and at the graves of lust you provoked the Lord :
And when he sent you from Cadesbarne , saying : Go up , and possess the land that I have given you , and you <unk> the commandment of the Lord your God , and did not believe him , neither would you hearken to his voice :
But were always rebellious from the day that I began to know you .
And I lay prostrate before the Lord forty days and nights , in which I <unk> besought him , that he would not destroy you as he had threatened :
And praying , I said : O Lord God , destroy not thy people , and thy inheritance , which thou hast redeemed in thy greatness , whom thou hast brought out of Egypt with a strong hand .
Remember thy servants Abraham , Isaac , and Jacob : look not on the <unk> of this people , nor on their wickedness and sin :
Lest perhaps the inhabitants of the land , out of which thou hast brought us , say : The Lord could not bring them into the land that he promised them , and he hated them : therefore he brought them out , that he might kill them in the wilderness , 9 : 29 . Who are thy people and thy inheritance , whom thou hast brought out by thy great strength , and in thy stretched out arm .
Deuteronomy Chapter 10 God giveth the second tables of the law : a further exhortation to fear and serve the Lord .
At that time the Lord said to me : <unk> thee two tables of stone like the former , and come up to me into the mount : and thou shalt make an ark of wood ,
And I will write on the tables the words that were in them , which thou <unk> before , and thou shalt put them in the ark .
And I made an ark of setim wood .
And when I had <unk> two tables of stone like the former , I went up into the mount , having them in my hands .
And he wrote in the tables , according as he had written before , the ten words , which the Lord spoke to you in the mount from the midst of the fire , when the people were assembled : and he gave them to me .
And returning from the mount , I came down , and put the tables into the ark , that I had made , and they are there till this present , as the Lord commanded me .
And the children of Israel removed their camp from <unk> , of the children of <unk> into <unk> , where Aaron died and was buried , and Eleazar his son succeeded him in the priestly office .
<unk> .... By mount <unk> , for there Aaron died , Num .
20 .
This and the following verses seem to be <unk> by way of <unk> .
From thence they came to <unk> , from which place they departed , and camped in <unk> , in a land of waters and torrents .
At that time he separated the tribe of Levi , to carry the ark of the covenant of the Lord , and to stand before him in the ministry , and to bless in his name until this present day .
Wherefore Levi hath no part nor possession with his brethren : because the Lord himself is his possession , as the Lord thy God promised him .
And I stood in the mount , as before , forty days and nights : and the Lord heard me this time also , and would not destroy thee .
And he said to me : Go , and walk before the people , that they may enter , and possess the land , which I swore to their fathers that I would give them .
And now , Israel , what doth the Lord thy God require of thee , but that thou fear the Lord thy God , and walk in his ways , and love him , and serve the Lord thy God , with all thy heart , and with all thy soul :
And keep the commandments of the Lord , and his ceremonies , which I command thee this day , that it may be well with thee ?
Behold heaven is the Lord ’ s thy God , and the heaven of heaven , the earth and all things that are therein .
And yet the Lord hath been <unk> joined to thy fathers , and loved them and chose their seed after them , that is to say , you , out of all nations , as this day it is proved .
<unk> therefore the <unk> of your heart , and <unk> your neck no more .
Because the Lord your God he is the God of gods , and the Lord of lords , a great God and mighty and terrible , who <unk> no person nor taketh bribes .
He doth judgment to the fatherless and the widow , loveth the stranger , and giveth him food and raiment .
And do you therefore love strangers , because you also were strangers in the land of Egypt .
Thou shalt fear the Lord thy God , and serve him only : to him thou shalt <unk> , and shalt swear by his name .
He is thy praise , and thy God , that hath done for thee these great and terrible things , which thy eyes have seen .
In seventy souls thy fathers went down into Egypt : and behold now the Lord thy God hath multiplied thee as the stars of heaven .
Deuteronomy Chapter 11 The love and service of God are still <unk> , with a blessing to them that serve him , and threats of punishment if they forsake his law .
Therefore love the Lord thy God and observe his precepts and ceremonies , his judgments and commandments at all times .
Know this day the things that your children know not , who saw not the <unk> of the Lord your God , his great doings and strong hand , and stretched out arm ,
The signs and works which he did in the midst of Egypt to king Pharao , and to all his land ,
And to all the host of the Egyptians , and to their horses and chariots : how the waters of the Red Sea covered them , when they pursued you , and how the Lord destroyed them until this present day :
And what he hath done to you in the wilderness , til you came to this place :
And to Dathan and Abiron the sons of Eliab , who was the son of Ruben : whom the earth , opening her mouth swallowed up with their <unk> and tents , and all their substance , which they had in the midst of Israel .
Your eyes have seen all the great works of the Lord , that he hath done ,
That you may keep all his commandments , which I command you this day , and may go in , and possess the land , to which you are entering ,
And may live in it a long time : which the Lord promised by oath to your fathers , and to their seed , a land which <unk> with milk and honey .
For the land , which thou goest to possess , is not like the land of Egypt , from whence thou camest out , where , when the seed is sown , waters are brought in to water it after the manner of gardens .
But it is a land of hills and plains , expecting rain from heaven .
And the Lord thy God doth always visit it , and his eyes are on it from the beginning of the year unto the end thereof .
If then you obey my commandments , which I command you this day , that you love the Lord your God , and serve him with all your heart , and with all your soul :
He will give to your land the early rain and the latter rain , that you may gather in your corn , and your wine , and your oil ,
And your hay out of the fields to feed your cattle , and that you may eat and be filled .
Beware lest perhaps your heart be deceived , and you depart from the Lord , and serve strange gods , and adore them :
And the Lord being angry shut up heaven , that the rain come not down , nor the earth yield her fruit , and you perish quickly from the excellent land , which the Lord will give you .
Lay up these words in your hearts and minds , and hang them for a sign on your hands , and place them between your eyes .
<unk> your children that they meditate on them , when thou sittest in thy house , and when thou <unk> on the way , and when thou <unk> down and <unk> up .
Thou shalt write them upon the posts and the doors of thy house :
That thy days may be multiplied , and the days of thy children in the land which the Lord swore to thy fathers , that he would give them as long as the heaven hangeth over the earth .
For if you keep the commandments which I command you , and do them , to love the Lord your God , and walk in all his ways , <unk> unto him ,
The Lord will destroy all these nations before your face , and you shall possess them , which are greater and stronger than you .
Every place , that your foot shall tread upon , shall be yours .
From the desert , and from Libanus , from the great river Euphrates unto the <unk> sea shall be your borders .
<unk> shall stand against you : the Lord your God shall lay the dread and fear of you upon all the land that you shall tread upon , as he hath spoken to you .
Behold I set forth in your sight this day a blessing and a curse :
A blessing , if you obey the commandments of the Lord your God , which I command you this day :
A curse , if you obey not the commandments of the Lord your God , but revolt from the way which now I shew you , and walk after strange gods which you know not .
And when the Lord thy God shall have brought thee into the land , whither thou goest to dwell , thou shalt put the blessing upon mount <unk> , the curse upon mount <unk> : Put the blessing , <unk> .... See Deut .
<unk> , etc .
and Josue <unk> , etc .
Which are beyond the Jordan , behind the way that goeth to the setting of the sun , in the land of the Chanaanite who dwelleth in the plain country over against <unk> , which is near the valley that <unk> and entereth far .
For you shall pass over the Jordan , to possess the land , which the Lord your God will give you , that you may have it and possess it .
See therefore that you fulfil the ceremonies and judgments , which I shall set this day before you .
Deuteronomy Chapter 12 All idolatry must be <unk> : sacrifices , tithes , and firstfruits must be offered in one only place : all eating of blood is <unk> .
These are the precepts and judgments , that you must do in the land , which the Lord the God of thy fathers will give thee , to possess it all the days that thou shalt walk upon the earth .
Destroy all the places in which the nations , that you shall possess , worshipped their gods upon high mountains , and hills , and under every <unk> tree :
<unk> their altars , and break down their statues , burn their groves with fire , and break their idols in pieces : destroy their names out of those places .
You shall not do so to the Lord your God :
But you shall come to the place , which the Lord your God shall choose out of all your tribes , to put his name there , and to dwell in it :
And you shall offer in that place your holocausts and victims , the tithes and firstfruits of your hands and your vows and gifts , the firstborn of your herds and your sheep .
And you shall eat there in the sight of the Lord your God : and you shall rejoice in all things , whereunto you shall put your hand , you and your houses wherein the Lord your God hath blessed you .
You shall not do there the things we do here this day , every man that which seemeth good to himself .
For until this present time you are not come to rest , and to the possession , which the Lord your God will give you .
You shall pass over the Jordan , and shall dwell in the land which the Lord your God will give you , that you may have rest from all enemies round about : and may dwell without any fear ,
In the place , which the Lord your God shall choose , that his name may be therein .
<unk> shall you bring all the things that I command you , holocausts , and victims , and tithes , and the firstfruits of your hands : and whatsoever is the choicest in the gifts which you shall vow to the Lord .
There shall you feast before the Lord your God , you and your sons and your daughters , your <unk> and <unk> , and the Levite that dwelleth in your cities .
For he hath no other part and possession among you .
Beware lest thou offer thy holocausts in every place that thou shalt see :
But in the place which the Lord shall choose in one of thy tribes shalt thou offer sacrifices , and shalt do all that I command thee .
But if thou <unk> to eat , and the eating of flesh delight thee , kill , and eat according to the blessing of the Lord thy God , which he hath given thee , in thy cities : whether it be unclean , that is to say , having blemish or <unk> : or clean , that is to say , sound and without blemish , such as may be offered , as the <unk> , and the hart , shalt thou eat it :
Only the blood thou shalt not eat , but thou shalt pour it out upon the earth as water .
Thou mayst not eat in thy towns the tithes of thy corn , and thy wine , and thy oil , the firstborn of thy herds and thy cattle , nor any thing that thou <unk> , and that thou wilt offer <unk> , and the firstfruits of thy hands :
But thou shalt eat them before the Lord thy God in the place which the Lord thy God shall choose , thou and thy son and thy daughter , and thy manservant , and maidservant , and the Levite that dwelleth in thy cities : and thou shalt rejoice and be refreshed before the Lord thy God in all things , whereunto thou shalt put thy hand .
Take heed thou forsake not the Levite all the time that thou <unk> in the land .
When the Lord thy God shall have enlarged thy borders , as he hath spoken to thee , and thou wilt eat the flesh that thy soul desireth :
And if the place which the Lord thy God shall choose , that his name should be there , be far off , thou shalt kill of thy herds and of thy flocks , as I have commanded thee , and shalt eat in thy towns , as it pleaseth thee .
Even as the <unk> and the hart is eaten , so shalt thou eat them : both the clean and unclean shall eat of them alike .
Only beware of this , that thou eat not the blood , for the blood is for the soul : and therefore thou must not eat the soul with the flesh :
But thou shalt pour it upon the earth as water ,
That it may be well with thee and thy children after thee , when thou shalt do that which is pleasing in the sight of the Lord .
But the things which thou hast sanctified and vowed to the Lord , thou shalt take , and shalt come to the place which the Lord shall choose :
And shalt offer thy oblations , the flesh and the blood upon the altar of the Lord thy God : the blood of thy victims thou shalt pour on the altar : and the flesh thou thyself shalt eat .
<unk> and hear all the things that I command thee , that it may be well with thee and thy children after thee for ever , when thou shalt do what is good and pleasing in the sight of the Lord thy God .
When the Lord thy God shall have destroyed before thy face the nations , which thou shalt go in to possess , and when thou shalt possess them , and dwell in their land :
Beware lest thou <unk> them , after they are destroyed at thy coming in , and lest thou seek after their ceremonies , saying : As these nations have worshipped their gods , so will I also worship .
Thou shalt not do in like manner to the Lord thy God .
For they have done to their gods all the abominations which the Lord <unk> , offering their sons and daughters , and burning them with fire .
What I command thee , that only do thou to the Lord : neither add any thing , nor <unk> .
That only do thou , etc ....
They are forbid here to follow the ceremonies of the heathens ; or to make any <unk> in the divine ordinances .
Deuteronomy Chapter 13 <unk> prophets must be slain , and <unk> cities destroyed .
If there rise in the midst of thee a prophet or one that saith he hath dreamed a dream , and he <unk> a sign and a wonder ,
And that come to pass which he spoke , and he say to thee : Let us go and follow strange gods , which thou knowest not , and let us serve them :
Thou shalt not hear the words of that prophet or <unk> : for the Lord your God <unk> you , that it may appear whether you love him with all your heart , and with all your soul , or not .
Follow the Lord your God , and fear him , and keep his commandments , and hear his voice : him you shall serve , and to him you shall cleave .
And that prophet or <unk> of dreams shall be slain : because he spoke to draw you away from the Lord your God , who brought you out of the land of Egypt , and redeemed you from the house of bondage : to make thee go out of the way , which the Lord thy God commanded thee : and thou shalt take away the evil out of the midst of thee .
If thy brother the son of thy mother , or thy son , or daughter , or thy wife that is in thy bosom , or thy friend , whom thou lovest as thy own soul , would persuade thee secretly , saying : Let us go , and serve strange gods , which thou knowest not , nor thy fathers ,
Of all the nations round about , that are near or afar off , from one end of the earth to the other ,
<unk> not to him , hear him not , neither let thy eye spare him to pity and <unk> him ,
But thou shalt presently put him to death .
Let thy hand be first upon him , and afterwards the hands of all the people .
<unk> put him to death .... Not by killing him by private authority , but by <unk> the <unk> , and <unk> by order of justice .
With stones shall he be stoned to death : because he would have withdrawn thee from the Lord thy God , who brought thee out of the land of Egypt , from the house of bondage :
That all Israel hearing may fear , and may do no more any thing like this .
If in one of thy cities , which the Lord thy God shall give thee to dwell in , thou hear some say :
Children of Belial are gone out of the midst of thee , and have withdrawn the inhabitants of their city , and have said : Let us go , and serve strange gods which you know not : Belial .... That is , without yoke .
<unk> the wicked , who refuse to be subject to the divine law , are called in scripture the children of Belial .
<unk> carefully and diligently , the truth of the thing by looking well into it , and if thou find that which is said to be certain , and that this abomination hath been <unk> committed ,
Thou shalt forthwith kill the inhabitants of that city with the edge of the sword , and shalt destroy it and all things that are in it , even the cattle .
And all the household goods that are there , thou shalt gather together in the midst of the streets thereof , and shall burn them with the city itself , so as to <unk> all for the Lord thy God , and that it be a heap for ever : it shall be built no more .
And there shall nothing of that anathema stick to thy hand : that the Lord may turn from the wrath of his fury , and may have mercy on thee , and multiply thee as he swore to thy fathers ,
When thou shalt hear the voice of the Lord thy God , keeping all his precepts , which I command thee this day , that thou mayst do what is pleasing in the sight of the Lord thy God .
Deuteronomy Chapter 14 In mourning for the dead they are not to follow the ways of the Gentiles : the distinction of clean and unclean meats : ordinances concerning tithes , and firstfruits .
Be ye children of the Lord your God : you shall not cut yourselves , nor make any <unk> for the dead ;
Because thou art a holy people to the Lord thy God : and he chose thee to be his peculiar people of all nations that are upon the earth .
Eat not the things that are unclean .
<unk> .... See the <unk> on <unk> .
11 .
These are the beasts that you shall eat , the ox , and the sheep , and the goat ,
The hart and the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the wild goat , the <unk> .
Every beast that divideth the hoof in two parts , and <unk> the cud , you shall eat .
But of them that <unk> the cud , but divide not the hoof , you shall not eat , such as the camel , the <unk> , and the <unk> : because they <unk> the cud , but divide not the hoof , they shall be unclean to you .
The swine also , because it divideth the hoof , but <unk> not the cud , shall be unclean , their flesh you shall not eat , and their carcasses you shall not touch .
These shall you eat of all that abide in the waters : All that have <unk> and scales , you shall eat .
Such as are without <unk> and scales , you shall not eat , because they are unclean .
All birds that are clean you shall eat .
The unclean eat not : to wit , the eagle , and the <unk> , and the <unk> ,
The <unk> , and the <unk> , and the <unk> according to their kind :
And all of the raven ’ s kind :
And the <unk> , and the <unk> , and the <unk> , and the <unk> according to its kind :
The <unk> , and the <unk> , and the <unk> ,
And the <unk> , the <unk> , and the night <unk> ,
The <unk> , and the <unk> , every one in their kind : the <unk> also and the <unk> .
Every thing that <unk> , and hath little wings , shall be unclean , and shall not be eaten .
All that is clean , you shall eat .
But whatsoever is dead of itself , eat not thereof .
Give it to the stranger , that is within thy gates , to eat , or sell it to him : because thou art the holy people of the Lord thy God .
Thou shalt not boil a kid in the milk of his <unk> .
Every year thou shalt set aside the tithes of all thy fruits that the earth bringeth forth ,
And thou shalt eat before the Lord thy God in the place which he shall choose , that his name may be called upon therein , the <unk> of thy corn , and thy wine , and thy oil , and the firstborn of thy herds and thy sheep : that thou mayst learn to fear the Lord thy God at all times .
But when the way and the place which the Lord thy God shall choose , are far off , and he hath blessed thee , and thou canst not carry all these things thither ,
Thou shalt sell them all , and turn them into money , and shalt carry it in thy hand , and shalt go to the place which the Lord shall choose :
And thou shalt buy with the same money whatsoever pleaseth thee , either of the herds or of sheep , wine also and strong drink , and all that thy soul desireth : and thou shalt eat before the Lord thy God , and shalt feast , thou and thy house :
And the Levite that is within thy gates , beware thou forsake him not , because he hath no other part in thy possession .
The third year thou shalt separate another <unk> of all things that grow to thee at that time , and shalt lay it up within thy gates .
And the Levite that hath no other part nor possession with thee , and the stranger and the fatherless and the widow , that are within thy gates , shall come and shall eat and be filled : that the Lord thy God may bless thee in all the works of thy hands that thou shalt do .
Deuteronomy Chapter 15 The law of the seventh year of remission .
The <unk> of cattle are to be sanctified to the Lord .
In the seventh year thou shalt make a remission ,
Which shall be celebrated in this order .
He to whom any thing is <unk> from his friend or neighbour or brother , cannot demand it again , because it is the year of remission of the Lord .
Of the <unk> or stranger thou mayst exact it : of thy <unk> and neighbour thou shalt not have power to demand it again .
And there shall be no poor nor <unk> among you : that the Lord thy God may bless thee in the land which he will give thee in possession .
There shall be no poor , etc ....
It is not to be understood as a promise , that there should be no poor in Israel , as appears from ver .
11 , where we learn that God ’ s people would never be at a loss to find <unk> for their charity : but it is an ordinance that all should do their best <unk> to prevent any of their brethren from suffering the <unk> of poverty and want .
Yet so if thou hear the voice of the Lord thy God , and keep all things that he hath ordained , and which I command thee this day , he will bless thee , as he hath promised .
Thou shalt lend to many nations , and thou shalt <unk> of no man .
Thou shalt have dominion over very many nations , and no one shall have dominion over thee .
If one of thy brethren that dwelleth within thy gates of thy city in the land which the Lord thy God will give thee , come to poverty : thou shalt not harden thy heart , nor close thy hand ,
But shalt open it to the poor man , thou shalt lend him , that which thou <unk> he hath need of .
Beware lest perhaps a wicked thought steal in upon thee , and thou say in thy heart : The seventh year of remission <unk> nigh ; and thou turn away thy eyes from thy poor brother , denying to lend him that which he asketh : lest he cry against thee to the Lord , and it become a sin unto thee .
But thou shalt give to him : neither shalt thou do any thing <unk> in <unk> his necessities : that the Lord thy God may bless thee at all times , and in all things to which thou shalt put thy hand .
There will not be wanting poor in the land of thy habitation : therefore I command thee to open thy hand to thy needy and poor brother , that liveth in the land .
When thy brother a Hebrew man , or Hebrew woman is sold to thee , and hath served thee six years , in the seventh year thou shalt let him go free :
And when thou <unk> him out free , thou shalt not let him go away empty :
But shall give him for his way out of thy flocks , and out of thy <unk> , and thy winepress , wherewith the Lord thy God shall bless thee .
Remember that thou also wast a <unk> in the land of Egypt , and the Lord thy God made thee free , and therefore I now command thee this .
But if he say : I will not depart : because he loveth thee , and thy house , and findeth that he is well with thee :
Thou shalt take an <unk> , and bore through his ear in the door of thy house , and he shall serve thee for ever : thou shalt do in like manner to thy <unk> also .
Turn not away thy eyes from them when thou makest them free : because he hath served thee six years according to the wages of a hireling : that the Lord thy God may bless thee in all the works that thou dost .
Of the <unk> , that come of thy herds and thy sheep , thou shalt sanctify to the Lord thy God whatsoever is of the male sex .
Thou shalt not work with the <unk> of a bullock , and thou shalt not <unk> the <unk> of thy sheep .
In the sight of the Lord thy God shalt thou eat them every year , in the place that the Lord shall choose , thou and thy house .
But if it have a blemish , or be lame , or blind , or in any part <unk> or feeble , it shall not be sacrificed to the Lord thy God .
But thou shalt eat it within the gates of thy city : the clean and the unclean shall eat them alike , as the <unk> and as the hart .
Only thou shalt take heed not to eat their blood , but pour it out on the earth as water .
Deuteronomy Chapter 16 The three principal solemnities to be observed : just judges to be appointed in every city : all occasions of idolatry to be <unk> .
<unk> the month of new corn , which is the first of the spring , that thou mayst celebrate the phase to the Lord thy God : because in this month the Lord thy God brought thee out of Egypt by night .
And thou shalt sacrifice the phase to the Lord thy God , of sheep , and of oxen , in the place which the Lord thy God shall choose , that his name may dwell there .
Thou shalt not eat with it leavened bread : seven days shalt thou eat without leaven , the bread of affliction , because thou camest out of Egypt in fear : that thou mayst remember the day of thy coming out of Egypt , all the days of thy life .
No leaven shall be seen in all thy coasts for seven days , neither shall any of the flesh of that which was sacrificed the first day in the evening remain until morning .
Thou mayst not immolate the phase in any one of thy cities , which the Lord thy God will give thee :
But in the place which the Lord thy God shall choose , that his name may dwell there : thou shalt immolate the phase in the evening , at the going down of the sun , at which time thou camest out of Egypt .
And thou shalt dress , and eat it in the place which the Lord thy God shall choose , and in the morning rising up thou shalt go into thy dwellings .
Six days shalt thou eat unleavened bread : and on the seventh day , because it is the assembly of the Lord thy God , thou shalt do no work .
Thou shalt number unto thee seven weeks from that day , wherein thou didst put the sickle to the corn .
And thou shalt celebrate the festival of weeks to the Lord thy God , a <unk> oblation of thy hand , which thou shalt offer according to the blessing of the Lord thy God .
And thou shalt feast before the Lord thy God , thou , and thy son , and thy daughter , and thy manservant , and thy maidservant , and the Levite that is within thy gates , and the stranger and the fatherless , and the widow , who abide with you : in the place which the Lord thy God shall choose , that his name may dwell there :
And thou shalt remember that thou wast a servant in Egypt : and thou shalt keep and do the things that are commanded .
Thou shalt celebrate the solemnity also of tabernacles seven days , when thou hast gathered in thy fruit of the <unk> and of the winepress .
And thou shalt make merry in thy festival time , thou , thy son , and thy daughter , thy manservant , and thy maidservant , the Levite also and the stranger , and the fatherless and the widow that are within thy gates .
Seven days shalt thou celebrate feasts to the Lord thy God in the place which the Lord shall choose : and the Lord thy God will bless thee in all thy fruits , and in every work of thy hands , and thou shalt be in joy .
Three times in a year shall all thy males appear before the Lord thy God in the place which he shall choose : in the feast of unleavened bread , in the feast of weeks , and in the feast of tabernacles .
No one shall appear with his hands empty before the Lord :
But every one shall offer according to what he hath , according to the blessing of the Lord his God , which he shall give him .
Thou shalt appoint judges and magistrates in all thy gates , which the Lord thy God shall give thee , in all thy tribes : that they may judge the people with just judgment ,
And not go aside to either part .
Thou shalt not accept person nor gifts : for gifts blind the eyes of the wise , and change the words of the just .
Thou shalt follow justly after that which is just : that thou mayst live and possess the land , which the Lord thy God shall give thee .
Thou shalt plant no grove , nor any tree near the altar of the Lord thy God :
Neither shalt thou make nor set up to thyself a statue : which things the Lord thy God hateth .
Deuteronomy Chapter 17 <unk> must be without blemish .
<unk> are to be slain .
<unk> are to be <unk> by the high priest and council , whose sentence must be obeyed under pain of death .
The duty of a king , who is to receive the law of God at the priest ’ s hands .
Thou shalt not sacrifice to the Lord thy God a sheep , or an ox , wherein there is blemish , or any fault : for that is an abomination to the Lord thy God .
When there shall be found among you within any of thy gates , which the Lord thy God shall give thee , man or woman that do evil in the sight of the Lord thy God , and transgress his covenant ,
So as to go and serve strange gods , and adore them , the sun and the moon , and all the host of heaven , which I have not commanded : The host of heaven .... That is , the stars .
And this is told thee , and hearing it thou hast inquired diligently , and found it to be true , and that the abomination is committed in Israel :
Thou shalt bring forth the man or the woman , who have committed that most wicked thing , to the gates of thy city , and they shall be stoned .
By the mouth of two or three witnesses shall he die that is to be slain .
Let no man be put to death , when only one beareth witness against him .
The hands of the witnesses shall be first upon him to kill him , and afterwards the hands of the rest of the people : that thou mayst take away the evil out of the midst of thee .
If thou perceive that there be among you a hard and <unk> matter in judgment between blood and blood , cause and cause , leprosy and leprosy : and thou see that the words of the judges within thy gates do <unk> : arise , and go up to the place , which the Lord thy God shall choose .
If thou perceive , etc ....
Here we see what authority God was pleased to give to the church <unk> of the Old Testament , in <unk> , without <unk> , all <unk> relating to the law ; promising that they should not err therein ; and surely he has not done less for the church <unk> of the New Testament .
And thou shalt come to the priests of the Levitical race , and to the judge , that shall be at that time : and thou shalt ask of them , and they shall shew thee the truth of the judgment .
And thou shalt do whatsoever they shall say , that <unk> in the place , which the Lord shall choose , and what they shall teach thee ,
According to his law ; and thou shalt follow their sentence : neither shalt thou decline to the right hand nor to the left hand .
But he that will be proud , and refuse to obey the commandment of the priest , who <unk> at that time to the Lord thy God , and the decree of the judge , that man shall die , and thou shalt take away the evil from Israel :
And all the people hearing it shall fear , that no one afterwards <unk> with pride .
When thou art come into the land , which the Lord thy God will give thee , and <unk> it , and shalt say : I will set a king over me , as all nations have that are round about :
Thou shalt set him whom the Lord thy God shall choose out of the number of thy brethren .
Thou mayst not make a man of another nation king , that is not thy brother .
And when he is made king , he shall not multiply horses to himself , nor lead back the people into Egypt , being lifted up with the number of his horsemen , especially since the Lord hath commanded you to return no more the same way .
He shall not have many wives , that may <unk> his mind , nor immense <unk> of silver and gold .
But after he is raised to the throne of his kingdom , he shall copy out to himself the Deuteronomy of this law in a volume , taking the copy of the priests of the Levitical tribe ,
And he shall have it with him , and shall read it all the days of his life , that he may learn to fear the Lord his God , and keep his words and ceremonies , that are commanded in the law ;
And that his heart be not lifted up with pride over his brethren , nor decline to the right or to the left , that he and his sons may reign a long time over Israel .
Deuteronomy Chapter 18 The Lord is the inheritance of the priests and Levites .
<unk> abominations are to be <unk> .
The great <unk> <unk> is promised .
<unk> prophets must be slain .
The priests and Levites , and all that are of the same tribe , shall have no part nor inheritance with the rest of Israel , because they shall eat the sacrifices of the Lord , and his oblations ,
And they shall receive nothing else of the possession of their brethren : for the Lord himself is their inheritance , as he hath said to them .
This shall be the priest ’ s due from the people , and from them that offer victims : whether they sacrifice an ox , or a sheep , they shall give to the priest the shoulder and the breast :
The firstfruits also of corn , of wine , and of oil , and a part of the wool from the <unk> of their sheep .
For the Lord thy God hath chosen him of all thy tribes , to stand and to minister to the name of the Lord , him and his sons for ever .
If a Levite go out of any one of the cities throughout all Israel , in which he dwelleth , and have a <unk> mind to come to the place which the Lord shall choose ,
He shall minister in the name of the Lord his God , as all his brethren the Levites do , that shall stand at that time before the Lord .
He shall receive the same portion of food that the rest do : besides that which is due to him in his own city , by <unk> from his fathers .
When thou art come into the land which the Lord thy God shall give thee , beware lest thou have a mind to <unk> the abominations of those nations .
Neither let there be found among you any one that shall <unk> his son or daughter , making them to pass through the fire : or that <unk> soothsayers , or <unk> dreams and <unk> , neither let there be any <unk> ,
Nor <unk> , nor any one that <unk> <unk> spirits , or <unk> <unk> , or that seeketh the truth from the dead .
For the Lord <unk> all these things , and for these abominations he will destroy them at thy coming .
Thou shalt be perfect , and without spot before the Lord thy God .
These nations , whose land thou shalt possess , hearken to soothsayers and diviners : but thou art otherwise instructed by the Lord thy God .
The Lord thy God will raise up to thee a <unk> of thy nation and of thy brethren like unto me : him thou shalt hear :
As thou <unk> of the Lord thy God in Horeb , when the assembly was gathered together , and saidst : Let me not hear any more the voice of the Lord my God , neither let me see any more this exceeding great fire , lest I die .
And the Lord said to me : They have spoken all things well .
I will raise them up a prophet out of the midst of their brethren like to thee : and I will put my words in his mouth , and he shall speak to them all that I shall command him .
And he that will not hear his words , which he shall speak in my name , I will be the <unk> .
But the prophet , who being corrupted with pride , shall speak in my name things that I did not command him to say , or in the name of strange gods , shall be slain .
And if in silent thought thou answer : How shall I know the word that the Lord hath not spoken ?
Thou shalt have this sign : Whatsoever that same prophet foretelleth in the name of the Lord , and it cometh not to pass : that thing the Lord hath not spoken , but the prophet hath <unk> it by the pride of his mind : and therefore thou shalt not fear him .
Deuteronomy Chapter 19 The cities of refuge .
<unk> murder , and false witnesses must be punished .
When the Lord thy God hath destroyed the nations , whose land he will deliver to thee , and thou shalt possess it , and shalt dwell in the cities and houses thereof :
Thou shalt separate to thee three cities in the midst of the land , which the Lord will give thee in possession ,
<unk> diligently the way : and thou shalt divide the whole province of thy land equally into three parts : that he who is forced to flee for <unk> , may have near at hand whither to escape .
This shall be the law of the <unk> that fleeth , whose life is to be saved : He that killeth his <unk> <unk> , and who is proved to have had no hatred against him yesterday and the day before :
But to have gone with him to the wood to <unk> wood , and in <unk> down the tree the axe <unk> out of his hand , and the iron <unk> from the <unk> struck his friend , and killed him : he shall flee to one of the cities aforesaid , and live :
Lest perhaps the next kinsman of him whose blood was shed , <unk> on by his grief should pursue , and apprehend him , if the way be too long , and take away the life of him who is not guilty of death , because he is proved to have had no hatred before against him that was slain .
Therefore I command thee , that thou separate three cities at equal distance one from another .
And when the Lord thy God shall have enlarged thy borders , as he swore to thy fathers , and shall give thee all the land that he promised them ,
( Yet so , if thou keep his commandments , and do the things which I command thee this day , that thou love the Lord thy God , and walk in his ways at all times ) thou shalt add to thee other three cities , and shalt double the number of the three cities aforesaid :
That innocent blood may not be shed in the midst of the land which the Lord thy God will give thee to possess , lest thou be guilty of blood .
But if any man <unk> his neighbour , lie in wait for his life , and rise and strike him , and he die , and he flee to one of the cities aforesaid ,
The ancients of his city shall send , and take him out of the place of refuge , and shall deliver him into the hand of the kinsman of him whose blood was shed , and he shall die .
Thou shalt not pity him , and thou shalt take away the <unk> of innocent blood out of Israel , that it may be well with thee .
Thou shalt not take nor remove thy neighbour ’ s <unk> , which thy <unk> have set in thy possession , which the Lord thy God will give thee in the land that thou shalt receive to possess .
One witness shall not rise up against any man , whatsoever the sin or wickedness be : but in the mouth of two or three witnesses every word shall stand .
If a lying witness stand against a man , <unk> him of transgression ,
Both of them , between whom the <unk> is , shall stand before the Lord in the sight of the priests and the judges that shall be in those days .
And when after most diligent <unk> , they shall find that the false witness hath told a lie against his brother :
They shall render to him as he meant to do to his brother , and thou shalt take away the evil out of the midst of thee :
That others hearing may fear , and may not dare to do such things .
Thou shalt not pity him , but shalt require life for life , eye for eye , tooth for tooth , hand for hand , foot for foot .
Deuteronomy Chapter 20 <unk> relating to war .
If thou go out to war against thy enemies , and see horsemen and chariots , and the numbers of the enemy ’ s army greater than thine , thou shalt not fear them : because the Lord thy God is with thee , who brought thee out of the land of Egypt .
And when the battle is now at hand , the priest shall stand before the army , and shall speak to the people in this manner :
Hear , O Israel , you join battle this day against your enemies , let not your heart be dismayed , be not afraid , do not give back , fear ye them not :
Because the Lord your God is in the midst of you , and will fight for you against your enemies , to deliver you from danger .
And the captains shall proclaim through every band in the hearing of the army : What man is there , that hath built a new house , and hath not dedicated it ?
let him go and return to his house , lest he die in the battle , and another man <unk> it .
What man is there , that hath planted a vineyard , and hath not as yet made it to be common , whereof all men may eat ?
let him go , and return to his house , lest he die in the battle , and another man execute his office .
What man is there , that hath <unk> a wife , and not taken her ?
let him go , and return to his house , lest he die in the war , and another man take her .
After these things are declared they shall add the rest , and shall speak to the people : What man is there that is fearful , and faint <unk> ?
let him go , and return to his house , lest he make the hearts of his brethren to fear , as he himself is possessed with fear .
And when the captains of the army shall hold their peace , and have made an end of speaking , every man shall prepare their bands to fight .
If at any time thou come to fight against a city , thou shalt first offer it peace .
If they receive it , and open the gates to thee , all the people that are therein , shall be saved , and shall serve thee paying tribute .
But if they will not make peace , and shall begin war against thee , thou shalt besiege it .
And when the Lord thy God shall deliver it into thy hands , thou shalt slay all that are therein of the male sex , with the edge of the sword ,
<unk> women and children , cattle and other things , that are in the city .
And thou shalt divide all the prey to the army , and thou shalt eat the spoils of thy enemies , which the Lord thy God shall give thee .
So shalt thou do to all cities that are at a great distance from thee , and are not of these cities which thou shalt receive in possession .
But of those cities that shall be given thee , thou shalt suffer none at all to live :
But shalt kill them with the edge of the sword , to wit , the Hethite , and the Amorrhite , and the Chanaanite , the Pherezite , and the Hevite , and the Jebusite , as the Lord thy God hath commanded thee :
Lest they teach you to do all the abominations which they have done to their gods : and you should sin against the Lord your God .
When thou hast besieged a city a long time , and hath compassed it with bulwarks , to take it , thou shalt not cut down the trees that may be eaten of , neither shalt thou spoil the country round about with <unk> : for it is a tree , and not a man , neither can it increase the number of them that fight against thee .
But if there be any trees that are not fruitful , but wild , and fit for other uses , cut them down , and make engines , until thou take the city , which <unk> against thee .
Deuteronomy Chapter 21 The expiation of a secret murder .
The <unk> a captive .
The eldest son must not be deprived of his birthright for hatred of his mother .
A stubborn son is to be stoned to death .
When one is hanged on a gibbet , he must be taken down the same day and buried .
When there shall be found in the land , which the Lord thy God will give thee , the <unk> of a man slain , and it is not known who is guilty of the murder ,
Thy ancients and judges shall go out , and shall measure from the place where the body lieth the distance of every city round about :
And the ancients of that city which they shall perceive to be nearer than the rest , shall take a heifer of the herd , that hath not drawn in the yoke , nor <unk> the ground ,
And they shall bring her into a <unk> and <unk> valley , that never was <unk> , nor sown : and there they shall strike off the head of the heifer :
And the priests the sons of Levi shall come , whom the Lord thy God hath chosen to minister to him , and to bless in his name , and that by their word every matter should be <unk> , and whatsoever is clean or unclean should be judged .
And the ancients of that city shall come to the person slain , and shall wash their hands over the heifer that was killed in the valley ,
And shall say : Our hands did not shed this blood , nor did our eyes see it .
Be merciful to thy people Israel , whom thou hast redeemed , O Lord , and lay not innocent blood to their charge , in the midst of thy people Israel .
And the <unk> of blood shall be taken from them :
And thou shalt be free from the innocent ’ s blood , that was shed , when thou shalt have done what the Lord hath commanded thee .
If thou go out to fight against thy enemies , and the Lord thy God deliver them into thy hand , and thou lead them away captives ,
And seest in the number of the captives a beautiful woman , and lovest her , and wilt have her to wife ,
Thou shalt bring her into thy house : and she shall shave her hair , and <unk> her nails ,
And shall put off the raiment , wherein she was taken : and shall remain in thy house , and mourn for her father and mother one month : and after that thou shalt go in unto her , and shalt sleep with her , and she shall be thy wife .
But if afterwards she please thee not , thou shalt let her go free , but thou mayst not sell her for money nor oppress her by might because thou hast humbled her .
If a man have two wives , one beloved , and the other hated , and they have had children by him , and the son of the hated be the firstborn ,
And he meaneth to divide his substance among his sons : he may not make the son of the beloved the firstborn , and <unk> him before the son of the hated .
But he shall <unk> the son of the hated for the firstborn , and shall give him a double portion of all he hath : for this is the first of his children , and to him are due the first <unk> .
If a man have a stubborn and <unk> son , who will not hear the commandments of his father or mother , and being corrected , <unk> obedience :
They shall take him and bring him to the ancients of the city , and to the gate of judgment ,
And shall say to them : This our son is rebellious and stubborn , he <unk> hearing our <unk> , he giveth himself to <unk> , and to <unk> and <unk> :
The people of the city shall stone him : and he shall die , that you may take away the evil out of the midst of you , and all Israel hearing it may be afraid .
When a man hath committed a crime for which he is to be punished with death , and being condemned to die is hanged on a gibbet :
His body shall not remain upon the tree , but shall be buried the same day : for he is <unk> of God that hangeth on a tree : and thou shalt not defile thy land , which the Lord thy God shall give thee in possession .
Deuteronomy Chapter 22 <unk> towards neighbours .
Neither sex may use the apparel of the other .
<unk> to be <unk> even to birds .
<unk> about the roof of a house .
<unk> of divers kinds not to be mixed .
The punishment of him that <unk> his wife , as also of adultery and <unk> .
Thou shalt not pass by if thou seest thy brother ’ s ox , or his sheep go astray : but thou shalt bring them back to thy brother .
And if thy brother be not nigh , or thou know him not : thou shalt bring them to thy house , and they shall be with thee until thy brother seek them , and receive them .
Thou shalt do in like manner with his ass , and with his raiment , and with every thing that is thy brother ’ s , which is lost : if thou find it , neglect it not as <unk> to another .
If thou see thy brother ’ s ass or his ox to be fallen down in the way , thou shalt not <unk> it , but shalt lift it up with him .
A woman shall not be clothed with man ’ s apparel , neither shall a man use woman ’ s apparel : for he that doth these things is abominable before God .
If thou find as thou <unk> by the way , a bird ’ s nest in a tree , or on the ground , and the <unk> sitting upon the young or upon the <unk> : thou shalt not take her with her young : Thou shalt not take , etc .
This was to shew them to exercise a certain mercy even to <unk> creatures ; and by that means to <unk> them up to a horror of <unk> ; and to the exercise of humanity and <unk> charity one to another .
But shalt let her go , keeping the young which thou hast caught : that it may be well with thee , and thou mayst live a long time .
When thou <unk> a new house , thou shalt make a <unk> to the roof round about : lest blood be shed in thy house , and thou be guilty , if any one <unk> , and fall down headlong .
<unk> ....
This <unk> was necessary , because all their houses had flat tops , and it was usual to walk and to <unk> together upon them .
Thou shalt not sow thy vineyard with divers <unk> : lest both the seed which thou hast sown , and the fruit of the vineyard , be sanctified together .
Thou shalt not plough with an ox and an ass together .
Thou shalt not wear a garment that is woven of <unk> and linen together .
Thou shalt make <unk> in the <unk> at the four corners of thy cloak , wherewith thou shalt be covered .
If a man marry a wife , and afterwards hate her ,
And seek occasions to put her away , laying to her charge a very ill name , and say : I took this woman to wife , and going in to her , I found her not a virgin :
Her father and mother shall take her , and shall bring with them the <unk> of her virginity to the ancients of the city that are in the gate :
And the father shall say : I gave my daughter unto this man to wife : and because he hateth her ,
He layeth to her charge a very ill name , so as to say : I found not thy daughter a virgin : and behold these are the <unk> of my daughter ’ s virginity .
And they shall spread the cloth before the ancients of the city :
And the ancients of that city shall take that man , and beat him ,
<unk> him besides in a hundred sicles of silver , which he shall give to the damsel ’ s father , because he hath <unk> by a very ill name a virgin of Israel : and he shall have her to wife , and may not put her away all the days of his life .
But if what he charged her with be true , and virginity be not found in the damsel :
They shall cast her out of the doors of her father ’ s house , and the men of the city shall stone her to death , and she shall die : because she hath done a wicked thing in Israel , to play the <unk> in her father ’ s house : and thou shalt take away the evil out of the midst of thee .
If a man lie with another man ’ s wife , they shall both die , that is to say , the <unk> and the <unk> : and thou shalt take away the evil out of Israel .
If a man have <unk> a damsel that is a virgin , and some one find her in the city , and lie with her ,
Thou shalt bring them both out to the gate of that city , and they shall be stoned : the damsel , because she cried not out , being in the city : the man , because he hath humbled his neighbour ’ s wife .
And thou shalt take away the evil from the midst of thee .
But if a man find a damsel that is <unk> , in the field , and taking hold of her , lie with her , he alone shall die :
The damsel shall suffer nothing , neither is she guilty of death : for as a robber riseth against his brother , and taketh away his life , so also did the damsel suffer :
She was alone in the field : she cried , and there was no man to help her .
If a man find a damsel that is a virgin , who is not <unk> , and taking her , lie with her , and the matter come to judgment :
He that lay with her shall give to the father of the maid fifty sicles of silver , and shall have her to wife , because he hath humbled her : he may not put her away all the days of his life .
No man shall take his father ’ s wife , nor remove his covering .
Deuteronomy Chapter 23 Who may and who may not enter into the church : uncleanness to be <unk> : other precepts concerning fugitives , fornication , usury , vows , and eating other men ’ s grapes and corn .
An eunuch , whose <unk> are broken or cut away , or <unk> cut off , shall not enter into the church of the Lord .
<unk> .... By these are meant , in the spiritual sense , such as are barren in good works .
Ibid .
Into the church .... That is , into the assembly or congregation of Israel , so as to have the <unk> of an <unk> , or to be <unk> of any place or office among the people of God .
A <unk> , that is to say , one born of a <unk> , shall not enter into the church of the Lord , until the tenth generation .
The <unk> and the <unk> , even after the tenth generation shall not enter into the church of the Lord for ever :
Because they would not meet you with bread and water in the way , when you came out of Egypt : and because they hired against thee Balaam , the son of Beor , from Mesopotamia in Syria , to curse thee .
And the Lord thy God would not hear Balaam , and he turned his cursing into thy blessing , because he loved thee .
Thou shalt not make peace with them , neither shalt thou seek their prosperity all the days of thy life for ever .
Thou shalt not abhor the <unk> , because he is thy brother : nor the Egyptian , because thou wast a stranger in his land .
They that are born of them , in the third generation shall enter into the church of the Lord .
When thou goest out to war against thy enemies , thou shalt keep thyself from every evil thing .
If there be among you any man , that is defiled in a dream by night , he shall go forth out of the camp ,
And shall not return , before he be washed with water in the evening : and after <unk> he shall return into the camp .
Thou shalt have a place without the camp , to which thou mayst go for the necessities of nature ,
<unk> a <unk> at thy girdle .
And when thou sittest down , thou shalt dig round about , and with the earth that is dug up thou shalt cover
That which thou art <unk> of : ( for the Lord thy God walketh in the midst of thy camp , to deliver thee , and to give up thy enemies to thee : ) and let thy camp be holy , and let no uncleanness appear therein , lest he go away from thee .
No uncleanness ....
This <unk> against suffering any filth in the camp , was to teach them to fly the filth of sin , which driveth God away from the soul .
Thou shalt not deliver to his master the servant that is fled to thee .
He shall dwell with thee in the place that shall please him , and shall rest in one of thy cities : give him no trouble .
There shall be no <unk> among the daughters of Israel , nor <unk> among the sons of Israel .
Thou shalt not offer the hire of a <unk> , nor the price of a dog , in the house of the Lord thy God , whatsoever it be that thou hast vowed : because both these are an abomination to the Lord thy God .
Thou shalt not lend to thy brother money to usury , nor corn , nor any other thing :
But to the stranger .
To thy brother thou shalt lend that which he wanteth , without usury : that the Lord thy God may bless thee in all thy works in the land , which thou shalt go in to possess .
To the stranger ....
This was a dispensation granted by God to his people , who being the Lord of all things , can give a right and title to one upon the goods of another .
Otherwise the scripture <unk> <unk> usury , as contrary to the law of God , and a crying sin .
See Ex .

When thou hast made a vow to the Lord thy God , thou shalt not delay to pay it : because the Lord thy God will require it .
And if thou delay , it shall be imputed to thee for a sin .
If thou wilt not promise , thou shalt be without sin .
But that which is once gone out of thy lips , thou shalt observe , and shalt do as thou hast promised to the Lord thy God , and hast spoken with thy own will and with thy own mouth .
<unk> into thy neighbour ’ s vineyard , thou mayst eat as many grapes as thou <unk> : but must carry none out with thee :
If thou go into thy friend ’ s corn , thou mayst break the ears , and <unk> them in thy hand : but not reap them with a sickle .
Deuteronomy Chapter 24 <unk> permitted to avoid greater evil : the <unk> married must not go to war : of men <unk> , of leprosy , of <unk> , of labourers ’ hire , of justice , and of charity to the poor .
If a man take a wife , and have her , and she find not favour in his eyes , for some uncleanness : he shall write a <unk> of <unk> , and shall give it in her hand , and send her out of his house .
And when she is departed , and marrieth another husband ,
And he also hateth her , and hath given her a <unk> of <unk> , and hath sent her out of his house or is dead :
The former husband cannot take her again to wife : because she is defiled , and is become abominable before the Lord : lest thou cause thy land to sin , which the Lord thy God shall give thee to possess .
When a man hath <unk> taken a wife , he shall not go out to war , neither shall any public business be <unk> him , but he shall be free at home without fault , that for one year he may rejoice with his wife .
Thou shalt not take the <unk> , nor the upper <unk> to pledge : for he hath <unk> his life to thee .
If any man be found <unk> his brother of the children of Israel , and <unk> him shall take a price , he shall be put to death , and thou shalt take away the evil from the midst of thee .
<unk> diligently that thou <unk> not the stroke of the leprosy , but thou shalt do whatsoever the priests of the Levitical race shall teach thee , according to what I have commanded them , and fulfil thou it carefully .
Remember what the Lord your God did to Mary , in the way when you came out of Egypt .
When thou shalt demand of thy neighbour any thing that he <unk> thee , thou shalt not go into his house to take away a pledge :
But thou shalt stand without , and he shall bring out to thee what he hath .
But if he be poor , the pledge shall not lodge with thee that night ,
But thou shalt restore it to him presently before the going down of the sun : that he may sleep in his own raiment and bless thee , and thou mayst have justice before the Lord thy God .
Thou shalt not refuse the hire of the needy , and the poor , whether he be thy brother , or a stranger that dwelleth with thee in the land , and is within thy gates :
But thou shalt pay him the price of his labour the same day , before the going down of the sun , because he is poor , and with it <unk> his life : lest he cry against thee to the Lord , and it be reputed to thee for a sin .
The fathers shall not be put to death for the children , nor the children for the fathers , but every one shall die for his own sin ,
Thou shalt not pervert the judgment of the stranger nor of the fatherless , neither shalt thou take away the widow ’ s raiment for a pledge .
Remember that thou wast a slave in Egypt , and the Lord thy God delivered thee from thence .
Therefore I command thee to do this thing .
When thou hast <unk> the corn in thy field , and hast forgot and left a <unk> , thou shalt not return to take it away : but thou shalt suffer the stranger , and the fatherless and the widow to take it away : that the Lord thy God may bless thee in all the works of thy hands .
If thou have gathered the fruit of thy olive trees , thou shalt not return to gather whatsoever remaineth on the trees : but shalt leave it for the stranger , for the fatherless , and the widow .
If thou make the vintage of thy vineyard , thou shalt not gather the <unk> that remain , but they shall be for the stranger , the fatherless , and the widow .
Remember that thou also wast a bondman in Egypt , and therefore I command thee to do this thing .
Deuteronomy Chapter 25 <unk> must not <unk> forty .
The ox is not to be <unk> .
Of <unk> seed to the brother .
Of the <unk> woman .
Of unjust weight .
Of destroying the Amalecites .
If there be a <unk> between men , and they call upon the judges : they shall give the <unk> of justice to him whom they perceive to be just : and him whom they find to be wicked , they shall condemn of wickedness .
And if they see that the <unk> be worthy of stripes : they shall lay him down , and shall cause him to be beaten before them .
According to the measure of the sin shall the measure also of the stripes be :
Yet so , that they <unk> not the number of forty : lest thy brother depart <unk> torn before thy eyes .
Thou shalt not <unk> the ox that <unk> out thy corn on the floor .
Not <unk> , etc .... St. Paul <unk> this of the spiritual <unk> in the church of God , who is not to be denied his <unk> .
1 Cor .
<unk> , 9 , 10 .
When brethren dwell together , and one of them dieth without children , the wife of the <unk> shall not marry to another : but his brother shall take her , and raise up seed for his brother :
And the first son he shall have of her he shall call by his name , that his name be not abolished out of Israel .
But if he will not take his brother ’ s wife , who by law belongeth to him , the woman shall go to the gate of the city , and call upon the ancients , and say : My husband ’ s brother <unk> to raise up his brother ’ s name in Israel : and will not take me to wife .
And they shall cause him to be sent for forthwith , and shall ask him .
If he answer : I will not take her to wife :
The woman shall come to him before the ancients , and shall take off his <unk> from his foot , and <unk> in his face , and say : So shall it be done to the man that will not build up his brother ’ s house :
And his name shall be called in Israel , the house of the <unk> .
If two men have words together , and one begin to fight against the other , and the other ’ s wife willing to deliver her husband out of the hand of the stronger , shall put forth her hand , and take him by the secrets ,
Thou shalt cut off her hand , neither shalt thou be moved with any pity in her regard .
Thou shalt not have divers <unk> in thy <unk> , a greater and a less :
Neither shall there be in thy house a greater <unk> and a less .
Thou shalt have a just and a true weight , and thy <unk> shall be equal and true : that thou mayest live a long time upon the land which the Lord thy God shall give thee .
For the Lord thy God <unk> him that doth these things , and he hateth all injustice .
Remember what Amalec did to thee in the way when thou camest out of Egypt : Amalec ....
This order for destroying the Amalecites , in the mystical sense , sheweth how hateful they are to God , and what punishments they are to look for from his justice , who <unk> and <unk> his servants when they are but just come out , as it were , of the Egypt of this wicked world and being yet weak and <unk> , are but beginning their journey to the land of promise .
How he met thee : and slew the <unk> of the army , who sat down , being weary , when thou wast spent with hunger and labour , and he feared not God .
Therefore when the Lord thy God shall give thee rest , and shall have subdued all the nations round about in the land which he hath promised thee : thou shalt blot out his name from under heaven .
See thou forget it not .
Deuteronomy Chapter 26 The form of words with which the firstfruits and tithes are to be offered .
God ’ s covenant .
And when thou art come into the land which the Lord thy God will give thee to possess , and hast conquered it , and dwellest in it :
Thou shalt take the first of all thy fruits , and put them in a basket , and shalt go to the place which the Lord thy God shall choose , that his name may be <unk> there :
And thou shalt go to the priest that shall be in those days , and say to him : I <unk> this day before the Lord thy God , that I am come into the land , for which he swore to our fathers , that he would give it us .
And the priest taking the basket at thy hand , shall set it before the altar of the Lord thy God :
And thou shalt speak thus in the sight of the Lord thy God : The Syrian pursued my father , who went down into Egypt , and sojourned there in a very small number , and grew into a nation great and strong and of an infinite multitude .
The Syrian .... Laban .
See Gen. 27 .
And the Egyptians afflicted us , and persecuted us , laying on us most grievous burdens :
And we cried to the Lord God of our fathers : who heard us , and looked down upon our affliction , and labour , and distress :
And brought us out of Egypt with a strong hand , and a stretched out arm , with great terror , with signs and wonders :
And brought us into this place , and gave us this land flowing with milk and honey .
And therefore now I offer the firstfruits of the land which the Lord hath given me .
And thou shalt leave them in the sight of the Lord thy God , adoring the Lord thy God .
And thou shalt feast in all the good things which the Lord thy God hath given thee , and thy house , thou and the Levite , and the stranger that is with thee .
When thou hast made an end of <unk> all thy fruits , in the third year of tithes thou shalt give it to the Levite , and to the stranger , and to the fatherless , and to the widow , that they may eat within thy gates , and be filled :
And thou shalt speak thus in the sight of the Lord thy God : I have taken that which was sanctified out of my house , and I have given it to the Levite , and to the stranger , and to the fatherless , and to the widow , as thou hast commanded me : I have not transgressed thy commandments nor forgotten thy precepts .
I have not eaten of them in my mourning , nor separated them for any uncleanness , nor spent any thing of them in <unk> .
I have obeyed the voice of the Lord my God , and have done all things as thou hast commanded me .
Look from thy sanctuary , and thy high habitation of heaven , and bless thy people Israel , and the land which thou hast given us , as thou didst swear to our fathers , a land flowing with milk and honey .
This day the Lord thy God hath commanded thee to do these commandments and judgments : and to keep and fulfil them with all thy heart , and with all thy soul .
Thou hast chosen the Lord this day to be thy God , and to walk in his ways and keep his ceremonies , and precepts , and judgments , and obey his command .
And the Lord hath chosen thee this day , to be his peculiar people , as he hath spoken to thee , and to keep all his commandments :
And to make thee higher than all nations which he hath created , to his own praise , and name , and glory : that thou mayst be a holy people of the Lord thy God , as he hath spoken .
Deuteronomy Chapter 27 The commandments must be written on stones : and an altar erected , and sacrifices offered .
The <unk> of the commandments are to be blessed , and the transgressors cursed .
And Moses with the ancients of Israel commanded the people , saying : Keep every commandment that I command you this day .
And when you are passed over the Jordan into the land which the Lord thy God will give thee , thou shalt set up great stones , and shalt <unk> them over with <unk> ,
That thou mayst write on them all the words of this law , when thou art passed over the Jordan : that thou mayst enter into the land which the Lord thy God will give thee , a land flowing with milk and honey , as he swore to thy fathers .
Therefore when you are passed over the Jordan , set up the stones which I command you this day , in mount <unk> , and thou shalt <unk> them with <unk> :
And thou shalt build there an altar to the Lord thy God , of stones which iron hath not touched ,
And of stones not fashioned nor <unk> : and thou shalt offer upon it holocausts to the Lord thy God :
And shalt immolate peace victims , and eat there , and feast before the Lord thy God .
And thou shalt write upon the stones all the words of this law plainly and clearly .
And Moses and the priests of the race of Levi said to all Israel : <unk> , and hear , O Israel : This day thou art made the people of the Lord thy God :
Thou shalt hear his voice , and do the commandments and justices which I command thee .
And Moses commanded the people in that day , saying :
These shall stand upon mount <unk> to bless the people , when you are passed the Jordan : Simeon , Levi , Juda , Issachar , Joseph , and Benjamin .
And over against them shall stand on mount <unk> to curse : Ruben , Gad , and Aser , and Zabulon , Dan , and Nephtali .
And the Levites shall <unk> , and say to all the men of Israel with a loud voice :
Cursed be the man that maketh a graven and molten thing , the abomination of the Lord , the work of the hands of artificers , and shall put it in a secret place : and all the people shall answer and say : Amen .
Cursed be he that honoureth not his father and mother : and all the people shall say : Amen .
Cursed be he that <unk> his neighbour ’ s <unk> : and all the people shall say : Amen .
Cursed be he that maketh the blind to wander out of his way : and all the people shall say : Amen .
Cursed be he that <unk> the judgment of the stranger , of the fatherless and the widow : and all the people shall say : Amen .
Cursed be he that lieth with his father ’ s wife , and <unk> his bed : and all the people shall say : Amen .
Cursed be he that lieth with any beast : and all the people shall say : Amen .
Cursed be he that lieth with his sister , the daughter of his father , or of his mother : and all the people shall say : Amen .
Cursed be he that lieth with his <unk> : and all the people shall say : Amen .
Cursed be he that secretly killeth his neighbour : and all the people shall say : Amen .
Cursed be he that taketh gifts , to slay an innocent person : and all the people shall say : Amen .
Cursed be he that abideth not in the words of this law , and <unk> them not in work : and all the people shall say : Amen .
Deuteronomy Chapter 28 Many blessings are promised to <unk> of God ’ s commandments : and curses threatened to transgressors .
Now if thou wilt hear the voice of the Lord thy God , to do and keep all his commandments , which I command thee this day , the Lord thy God will make thee higher than all the nations that are on the earth .
And all these blessings shall come upon thee and overtake thee : yet so if thou hear his precepts .
All these blessings , etc ....
In the Old Testament , God promised temporal blessings to the keepers of his law , heaven not being opened as yet ; and that <unk> and sensual people being more moved with present and <unk> things .
But in the New Testament the goods that are promised us are spiritual and eternal ; and temporal evils are turned into blessings .
Blessed shalt thou be in the city , and blessed in the field .
Blessed shall be the fruit of thy womb , and the fruit of thy ground , and the fruit of thy cattle , the <unk> of thy herds , and the <unk> of thy sheep .
Blessed shall be thy barns and blessed thy stores .
Blessed shalt thou be coming in and going out .
The Lord shall cause thy enemies , that rise up against thee , to fall down before thy face : one way shall they come out against thee , and seven ways shall they flee before thee .
The Lord will send forth a blessing upon thy storehouses , and upon all the works of thy hands : and will bless thee in the land that thou shalt receive .
The Lord will raise thee up to be a holy people to himself , as he swore to thee : if thou keep the commandments of the Lord thy God , and walk in his ways .
And all the people of the earth shall see that the name of the Lord is <unk> upon thee , and they shall fear thee .
The Lord will make thee abound with all goods , with the fruit of thy womb , and the fruit of thy cattle , with the fruit of thy land , which the Lord swore to thy fathers that he would give thee .
The Lord will open his excellent treasure , the heaven , that it may give rain in due season : and he will bless all the works of thy hands .
And thou shalt lend to many nations , and shalt not <unk> of any one .
And the Lord shall make thee the head and not the tail : and thou shalt be always above , and not beneath : yet so if thou wilt hear the commandments of the Lord thy God which I command thee this day , and keep and do them ,
And turn not away from them neither to the right hand , nor to the left , nor follow strange gods , nor worship them .
But if thou wilt not hear the voice of the Lord thy God , to keep and to do all his commandments and ceremonies , which I command thee this day , all these curses shall come upon thee , and overtake thee .
All these curses , etc ....
Thus God dealt with the transgressors of his law in the Old Testament : but now he often <unk> sinners to prosper in this world , <unk> them for some little good they have done , and <unk> their punishment for the other world .
Cursed shalt thou be in the city , cursed in the field .
Cursed shall be thy <unk> , and cursed thy stores .
Cursed shall be the fruit of thy womb , and the fruit of thy ground , the herds of thy oxen , and the flocks of thy sheep .
Cursed shalt thou be coming in , and cursed going out .
The Lord shall send upon thee famine and hunger , and a rebuke upon all the works which thou shalt do : until he consume and destroy thee quickly , for thy most wicked inventions , by which thou hast forsaken me .
May the Lord set the pestilence upon thee , until he consume thee out of the land , which thou shalt go in to possess .
May the Lord afflict thee with miserable want , with the <unk> and with cold , with burning and with heat , and with corrupted air and with <unk> , and pursue thee till thou perish .
Be the heaven , that is over thee , of brass : and the ground thou <unk> on , of iron .
The Lord give thee dust for rain upon thy land , and let ashes come down from heaven upon thee , till thou be consumed .
The Lord make thee to fall down before thy enemies , one way mayst thou go out against them , and flee seven ways , and be scattered throughout all the kingdoms of the earth .
And be thy carcass meat for all the fowls of the air , and the beasts of the earth , and be there none to drive them away .
The Lord strike thee with the <unk> of Egypt , and the part of thy body , by which the dung is cast out , with the <unk> and with the <unk> : so that thou canst not be healed .
The Lord strike thee with madness and blindness and fury of mind .
And mayst thou <unk> at <unk> as the blind is wont to <unk> in the dark , and not make straight thy ways .
And mayst thou at all times suffer wrong , and be oppressed with violence , and mayst thou have no one to deliver thee .
<unk> thou take a wife , and another sleep with her .
<unk> thou build a house , and not dwell therein .
<unk> thou plant a vineyard and not gather the vintage thereof .
May thy ox be slain before thee , and thou not eat thereof .
May thy ass be taken away in thy sight , and not restored to thee .
May thy sheep be given to thy enemies , and may there be none to help thee .
May thy sons and thy daughters be given to another people , thy eyes looking on , and <unk> at the sight of them all the day , and may there be no strength in thy hand .
May a people which thou knowest not , eat the fruits of thy land , and all thy labours : and mayst thou always suffer oppression , and be <unk> at all times .
And be astonished at the terror of those things which thy eyes shall see :
May the Lord strike thee with a very <unk> <unk> in the knees and in the legs , and be thou <unk> from the sole of the foot to the top of the head .
The Lord shall bring thee , and thy king , whom thou shalt have appointed over thee , into a nation which thou and thy fathers know not : and there thou shalt serve strange gods , wood and stone .
And thou shalt be lost , as a proverb and a <unk> to all people , among whom the Lord shall bring thee in .
Thou shalt cast much seed into the ground , and gather little : because the locusts shall consume all .
Thou shalt plant a vineyard , and dig it , and shalt not drink the wine , nor gather any thing thereof : because it shall be wasted with worms .
Thou shalt have olive trees in all thy borders , and shalt not be anointed with the oil : for the <unk> shall fall off and perish .
Thou shalt beget sons and daughters , and shalt not enjoy them : because they shall be led into captivity .
The blast shall consume all the trees and the fruits of thy ground .
The stranger that liveth with thee in the land , shall rise up over thee , and shall be higher : and thou shalt go down , and be lower .
He shall lend to thee , and thou shalt not lend to him .
He shall be as the head , and thou shalt be the tail .
And all these curses shall come upon thee , and shall pursue and overtake thee , till thou perish : because thou <unk> not the voice of the Lord thy God , and didst not keep his commandments and ceremonies which he commanded thee .
And they shall be as signs and wonders on thee , and on thy seed for ever .
Because thou didst not serve the Lord thy God with joy and gladness of heart , for the abundance of all things :
Thou shalt serve thy enemy , whom the Lord will send upon thee , in hunger , and thirst , and nakedness , and in want of all things : and he shall put an iron yoke upon thy neck , till he consume thee .
The Lord will bring upon thee a nation from afar , and from the uttermost ends of the earth , like an eagle that <unk> <unk> , whose tongue thou canst not understand ,
A most <unk> nation , that will shew no regard to the ancients , nor have pity on the infant ,
And will devour the fruit of thy cattle , and the fruits of thy land : until thou be destroyed , and will leave thee no wheat , nor wine , nor oil , nor herds of oxen , nor flocks of sheep : until he destroy thee .
And consume thee in all thy cities , and thy strong and high wall be brought down , wherein thou <unk> in all thy land .
Thou shalt be besieged within thy gates in all thy land which the Lord thy God will give thee :
And thou shalt eat the fruit of thy womb , and the flesh of thy sons and of thy daughters , which the Lord thy God shall give thee , in the distress and <unk> wherewith thy enemy shall oppress thee .
The man that is <unk> among you , and very delicate , shall envy his own brother , and his wife , that lieth in his bosom ,
So that he will not give them of the flesh of his children , which he shall eat : because he hath nothing else in the siege and the want , wherewith thy enemies shall distress thee within all thy gates .
The tender and delicate woman , that could not go upon the ground , nor set down her foot for over much <unk> and <unk> , will envy her husband who lieth in her bosom , the flesh of her son , and of her daughter ,
And the filth of the <unk> , that come forth from between her <unk> , and the children that are born the same hour .
For they shall eat them secretly for the want of all things , in the siege and distress , wherewith thy enemy shall oppress thee within thy gates .
If thou wilt not keep , and fulfil all the words of this law , that are written in this volume , and fear his glorious and terrible name : that is , The Lord thy God :
The Lord shall increase thy plagues , and the plagues of thy seed , plagues great and <unk> , infirmities grievous and perpetual .
And he shall bring back on thee all the afflictions of Egypt , which thou wast afraid of , and they shall stick fast to thee .
Moreover the Lord will bring upon thee all the diseases , and plagues , that are not written in the volume of this law till he consume thee :
And you shall remain few in number , who before were as the stars of heaven for multitude , because thou <unk> not the voice of the Lord thy God .
And as the Lord rejoiced upon you before doing good to you , and <unk> you : so he shall rejoice destroying and bringing you to nought , so that you shall be taken away from the land which thou shalt go in to possess .
The Lord shall scatter thee among all people , from the <unk> parts of the earth to the ends thereof : and there thou shalt serve strange gods , which both thou art ignorant of and thy fathers , wood and stone .
Neither shalt thou be quiet , even in those nations , nor shall there be any rest for the sole of thy foot .
For the Lord will give thee a fearful heart , and <unk> eyes , and a soul consumed with <unk> :
And thy life shall be as it were hanging before thee .
Thou shalt fear night and day , neither shalt thou trust thy life .
In the morning thou shalt say : Who will grant me evening ?
and at evening : Who will grant me morning ?
for the <unk> of thy heart , wherewith thou shalt be terrified , and for those things which thou shalt see with thy eyes .
The Lord shall bring thee again with ships into Egypt , by the way whereof he said to thee that thou shouldst see it no more .
There shalt thou be set to <unk> to thy enemies for bondmen and <unk> , and no man shall buy you .
Deuteronomy Chapter 29 The covenant is <unk> confirmed between God and his people .
<unk> against those that shall break it .
These are the words of the covenant which the Lord commanded Moses to make with the children of Israel in the land of Moab : beside that covenant which he made with them in Horeb .
And Moses called all Israel , and said to them : You have seen all the things that the Lord did before you in the land of Egypt to Pharao , and to all his servants , and to his whole land .
The great temptations , which thy eyes have seen , those mighty signs and wonders ,
And the Lord hath not given you a heart to understand , and eyes to see , and ears that may hear , unto this present day .
Hath not given you , etc ....
Through your own fault and because you resisted his grace .
He hath brought you forty years through the desert : your garments are not <unk> out , neither are the shoes of your feet consumed with age .
You have not eaten bread , nor have you drunk wine or strong drink : that you might know that I am the Lord your God .
And you came to this place : and Sehon king of Hesebon , and Og king of Basan , came out against us to fight .
And we slew them .
And took their land , and delivered it for a possession to Ruben and Gad , and the half tribe of Manasses .
Keep therefore the words of this covenant , and fulfil them : that you may understand all that you do .
You all stand this day before the Lord your God , your princes , and tribes , and ancients , and doctors , all the people of Israel ,
Your children and your wives , and the stranger that abideth with thee in the camp , besides the <unk> of wood , and them that bring water :
That thou mayst pass in the covenant of the Lord thy God , and in the oath which this day the Lord thy God maketh with thee .
That he may raise thee up a people to himself , and he may be thy God as he hath spoken to thee , and as he swore to thy fathers Abraham , Isaac , and Jacob .
Neither with you only do I make this covenant , and confirm these <unk> ,
But with all that are present and that are absent .
For you know how we dwelt in the land of Egypt , and how we have passed through the midst of nations , and passing through them ,
You have seen their abominations and filth , that is to say , their idols , wood and stone , silver and gold , which they worshipped .
Lest perhaps there should be among you a man or a woman , a family or a tribe , whose heart is turned away this day from the Lord our God , to go and serve the gods of those nations : and there should be among you a root bringing forth gall and bitterness .
And when he shall hear the words of this oath , he should bless himself in his heart saying : I shall have peace , and will walk on in the <unk> of my heart : and the drunken may consume the thirsty , The drunken , etc . , <unk> <unk> <unk> ....
It is a <unk> <unk> , which may either be understood , as spoken by the sinner , blessing , that is , <unk> himself in his sins with the <unk> of peace , and so great an abundance as may satisfy , and as it were , consume all thirst and want : or it may be <unk> to the root of bitterness , spoken of before , which being drunken with sin may <unk> , and by that means consume , such as thirst after the like evils .
And the Lord should not forgive him : but his wrath and jealousy against that man should be exceedingly enkindled at that time , and all the curses that are written in this volume should light upon him : and the Lord should blot out his name from under heaven ,
And utterly destroy him out of all the tribes of Israel , according to the curses that are contained in the book of this law and covenant :
And the following generation shall say , and the children that shall be born hereafter , and the strangers that shall come from afar , seeing the plagues of that land and the evils wherewith the Lord hath afflicted it ,
<unk> it with brimstone , and the heat of salt , so that it cannot be sown any more , nor any green thing grow therein , after the example of the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrha , <unk> and <unk> , which the Lord destroyed in his wrath and indignation :
And all the nations shall say : Why hath the Lord done thus to this land ?
what meaneth this exceeding great heat of his wrath ?
And they shall answer : Because they forsook the covenant of the Lord , which he made with their fathers , when he brought them out of the land of Egypt :
And they have served strange gods , and adored them , whom they knew not , and for whom they had not been <unk> :
Therefore the wrath of the Lord was kindled against this land , to bring upon it all the curses that are written in this volume :
And he hath cast them out of their land , in anger and in wrath , and in very great indignation , and hath thrown them into a strange land , as it is seen this day .
<unk> things to the Lord our God : things that are manifest , to us and to our children for ever , that we may do all the words of this law .
<unk> things , etc .... As much as to say , secret things belong to , and are known to , God alone ; our business must be to observe what he has revealed and manifested to us , and to direct our lives <unk> .
Deuteronomy Chapter 30 Great mercies are promised to the penitent : God ’ s commandment is <unk> .
<unk> and death are set before them .
Now when all these things shall be come upon thee , the blessing or the curse , which I have set forth before thee , and thou shalt be touched with repentance of thy heart among all the nations , into which the Lord thy God shall have scattered thee ,
And shalt return to him , and obey his commandments , as I command thee this day , thou and thy children , with all thy heart , and with all thy soul :
The Lord thy God will bring back again thy captivity , and will have mercy on thee , and gather thee again out of all the nations , into which he scattered thee before .
If thou be driven as far as the <unk> of heaven , the Lord thy God will fetch thee back from hence ,
And will take thee to himself , and bring thee into the land which thy fathers possessed , and thou shalt possess it : and blessing thee , he will make thee more numerous than were thy fathers .
The Lord thy God will <unk> thy heart , and the heart of thy seed : that thou mayst love the Lord thy God with all thy heart and with all thy soul , that thou mayst live .
And he will turn all these curses upon thy enemies , and upon them that hate and persecute thee .
But thou shalt return , and hear the voice of the Lord thy God , and shalt do all the commandments which I command thee this day :
And the Lord thy God will make thee abound in all the works of thy hands , in the fruit of thy womb , and in the fruit of thy cattle , in the <unk> of thy land , and in the plenty of all things .
For the Lord will return to rejoice over thee in all good things , as he rejoiced in thy fathers :
Yet so if thou hear the voice of the Lord thy God , and keep his precepts and ceremonies , which are written in this law : and return to the Lord thy God with all thy heart , and with all thy soul .
This commandment , that I command thee this day is not above thee , nor far off from thee :
Nor is it in heaven , that thou shouldst say : Which of us can go up to heaven to bring it unto us , and we may hear and fulfil it in work ?
Nor is it beyond the sea : that thou mayst <unk> thyself , and say : Which of us can cross the sea , and bring it unto us : that we may hear , and do that which is commanded ?
But the word is very nigh unto thee , in thy mouth and in thy heart , that thou mayst do it .
Consider that I have set before thee this day life and good , and on the other hand death and evil :
That thou mayst love the Lord thy God , and walk in his ways , and keep his commandments and ceremonies and judgments , and thou mayst live , and he may multiply thee , and bless thee in the land , which thou shalt go in to possess .
But if thy heart be turned away , so that thou wilt not hear , and being deceived with error thou adore strange gods , and serve them :
I <unk> thee this day that thou shalt perish , and shalt remain but a short time in the land , to which thou shalt pass over the Jordan , and shalt go in to possess it .
I call heaven and earth to witness this day , that I have set before you life and death , blessing and cursing .
<unk> therefore life , that both thou and thy seed may live :
And that thou mayst love the Lord thy God , and obey his voice , and <unk> to him ( for he is thy life , and the length of thy days , ) that thou mayst dwell in the land , for which the Lord swore to thy fathers Abraham , Isaac , and Jacob that he would give it them .
Deuteronomy Chapter 31 Moses <unk> the people , and Josue , who is appointed to succeed him .
He <unk> the law to the priests .
God foretelleth that the people will often forsake him , and that he will punish them .
He commandeth Moses to write a canticle , as a constant <unk> of the law .
And Moses went , and spoke all these words to all Israel ,
And he said to them : I am this day a hundred and twenty years old , I can no longer go out and come in , especially as the Lord also hath said to me : Thou shalt not pass over this Jordan .
The Lord thy God then will pass over before thee : he will destroy all these nations in thy sight , and thou shalt possess them : and this Josue shall go over before thee , as the Lord hath spoken .
And the Lord shall do to them as he did to Sehon and Og the kings of the Amorrhites , and to their land , and shall destroy them .
Therefore when the Lord shall have delivered these also to you , you shall do in like manner to them as I have commanded you .
Do manfully and be of good heart : fear not , nor be ye dismayed at their sight : for the Lord thy God he himself is thy leader , and will not leave thee nor forsake thee .
And Moses called Josue , and said to him before all Israel : Take courage , and be valiant : for thou shalt bring this people into the land which the Lord swore he would give to their fathers , and thou shalt divide it by lot .
And the Lord who is your leader , he himself will be with thee : he will not leave thee , nor forsake thee : fear not , neither be dismayed .
And Moses wrote this law , and delivered it to the priests the sons of Levi , who carried the ark of the covenant of the Lord , and to all the ancients of Israel .
And he commanded them , saying : After seven years , in the year of remission , in the feast of tabernacles ,
When all Israel come together , to appear in the sight of the Lord thy God in the place which the Lord shall choose , thou shalt read the words of this law before all Israel , in their hearing .
And the people being all assembled together , both men and women , children and strangers , that are within thy gates : that hearing they may learn , and fear the Lord your God , and keep , and fulfil all the words of this law :
That their children also , who now are ignorant , may hear , and fear the Lord their God , all the days that they live in the land whither you are going over the Jordan to possess it .
And the Lord said to Moses : Behold the days of thy death are nigh : call Josue , and stand ye in the tabernacle of the testimony , that I may give him a charge .
So Moses and Josue went and stood in the tabernacle of the testimony :
And the Lord appeared there in the pillar of a cloud , which stood in the entry of the tabernacle .
And the Lord said to Moses : Behold thou shalt sleep with thy fathers , and this people rising up will go a <unk> after strange gods in the land , to which it goeth in to dwell : there will they forsake me , and will make void the covenant , which I have made with them ,
And my wrath shall be kindled against them in that day : and I will forsake them , and will hide my face from them , and they shall be devoured : all evils and afflictions shall find them , so that they shall say in that day : In truth it is because God is not with me , that these evils have found me .
But I will hide , and cover my face in that day , for all the evils which they have done , because they have followed strange gods .
Now therefore write you this canticle , and teach the children of Israel : that they may know it by heart , and sing it by mouth , and this song may be unto me for a testimony among the children of Israel .
For I will bring them into the land , for which I swore to their fathers , that <unk> with milk and honey .
And when they have eaten , and are full and fat , they will turn away after strange gods , and will serve them : and will despise me , and make void my covenant .
And after many evils and afflictions shall have come upon them , this canticle shall answer them for a testimony , which no <unk> shall take away out of the mouth of their seed .
For I know their thoughts , and what they are about to do this day , before that I bring them into the land which I have promised them .
Moses therefore wrote the canticle , and taught it to the children of Israel .
And the Lord commanded Josue the son of Nun , and said : Take courage , and be valiant : for thou shalt bring the children of Israel into the land which I have promised , and I will be with thee .
Therefore after Moses had wrote the words of this law in a volume , and finished it :
He commanded the Levites , who carried the ark of the covenant of the Lord , saying :
Take this book , and put it in the side of the ark of the covenant of the Lord your God : that it may be there for a testimony against thee .
For I know thy obstinacy , and thy most <unk> neck .
While I am yet living , and going in with you , you have always been rebellious against the Lord : how much more when I shall be dead ?
Gather unto me all the ancients of your tribes , and your doctors , and I will speak these words in their hearing , and will call heaven and earth to witness against them .
For I know that , after my death , you will do wickedly , and will quickly turn aside from the way that I have commanded you : and evils shall come upon you in the latter times , when you shall do evil in the sight of the Lord , to provoke him by the works of your hands .
Moses therefore spoke , in the hearing of the whole assembly of Israel , the words of this canticle , and finished it even to the end .
Deuteronomy Chapter 32 A canticle for the remembrance of the law .
Moses is commanded to go up into a mountain , from whence he shall see the promised land but not enter into it .
Hear , O ye heavens , the things I speak , let the earth give ear to the words of my mouth .
Let my doctrine gather as the rain , let my speech <unk> as the dew , as a <unk> upon the herb , and as <unk> upon the grass .
Because I will <unk> the name of the Lord : give ye magnificence to our God .
The works of God are perfect , and all his ways are judgments : God is faithful and without any iniquity , he is just and right .
They have sinned against him , and are none of his children in their filth : they are a wicked and perverse generation .
Is this the return thou makest to the Lord , O foolish and senseless people ?
Is not he thy father , that hath possessed thee , and made thee , and created thee ?
Remember the days of old , think upon every generation : ask thy father , and he will declare to thee : thy elders and they will tell thee .
When the Most High divided the nations : when he separated the sons of Adam , he appointed the bounds of people according to the number of the children of Israel .
But the Lord ’ s portion is his people : Jacob the lot of his inheritance .
He found him in a desert land , in a place of horror , and of <unk> wilderness : he led him about , and taught him : and he kept him as the apple of his eye .
As the eagle <unk> her young to fly , and <unk> over them , he spread his wings , and hath taken him and carried him on his shoulders .
The Lord alone was his leader : and there was no strange god with him .
He set him upon high land : that he might eat the fruits of the fields , that he might suck honey out of the rock , and oil out of the <unk> stone ,
<unk> of the herd , and milk of the sheep with the fat of lambs , and of the rams of the <unk> of Basan : and goats with the marrow of wheat , and might drink the purest blood of the grape .
The beloved grew fat , and <unk> : he grew fat , and thick and <unk> , he forsook God who made him , and departed from God his saviour .
They provoked him by strange gods , and stirred him up to anger , with their abominations .
They sacrificed to devils and not to God : to gods whom they knew not : that were <unk> come up , whom their fathers worshipped not .
Thou hast forsaken the God that begot thee , and hast forgotten the Lord that created thee .
The Lord saw , and was moved to wrath : because his own sons and daughters provoked him .
And he said : I will hide my face from them , and will consider what their last end shall be : for it is a perverse generation , and <unk> children .
They have provoked me with that which was no god , and have <unk> me with their vanities : and I will provoke them with that which is no people , and will <unk> them with a foolish nation .
A fire is kindled in my wrath , and shall burn even to the lowest hell : and shall devour the earth with her increase , and shall burn the foundations of the mountains .
I will heap evils upon them , and will spend my arrows among them .
They shall be consumed with famine , and birds shall devour them with a most bitter bite : I will send the teeth of beasts upon them , with the fury of creatures that <unk> upon the ground , and of serpents .
Without , the sword shall lay them waste , and terror within , both the young man and the virgin , the <unk> child with the man in years .
I said : Where are they ?
I will make the memory of them to cease from among men .
But for the wrath of the enemies I have <unk> it : lest perhaps their enemies might be proud , and should say : Our mighty hand , and not the Lord , hath done all these things .
They are a nation without counsel , and without wisdom .
O that they would be wise and would understand , and would provide for their last end .
How should one pursue after a thousand , and two <unk> ten thousand ?
Was it not , because their God had sold them , and the Lord had shut them up ?
For our God is not as their gods : our enemies themselves are judges .
Their vines are of the vineyard of Sodom , and of the suburbs of Gomorrha : their grapes are grapes of gall , and their <unk> most bitter .
Their wine is the gall of dragons , and the <unk> of <unk> , which is <unk> .
Are not these things <unk> up with me , and sealed up in my treasures ?
<unk> is mine , and I will repay them in due time , that their foot may <unk> : the day of destruction is at hand , and the time makes haste to come .
The Lord will judge his people , and will have mercy on his servants : he shall see that their hand is weakened , and that they who were shut up have also failed , and they that remained are consumed .
And he shall say : Where are their gods , in whom they trusted ?
Of whose victims they ate the fat , and drank the wine of their drink offerings : let them arise and help you , and protect you in your distress .
See ye that I alone am , and there is no other God besides me : I will kill and I will make to live : I will strike , and I will heal , and there is none that can deliver out of my hand .
I will lift up my hand to heaven , and I will say : I live for ever .
If I shall <unk> my sword as the lightning , and my hand take hold on judgment : I will render vengeance to my enemies , and repay them that hate me .
I will make my arrows drunk with blood , and my sword shall devour flesh , of the blood of the slain and of the captivity , of the bare head of the enemies .
Praise his people , ye nations , for he will revenge the blood of his servants : and will render vengeance to their enemies , and he will be merciful to the land of his people .
So Moses came and spoke all the words of this canticle in the ears of the people , and Josue the son of Nun .
And he ended all these words , speaking to all Israel .
And he said to them : Set your hearts on all the words , which I testify to you this day : which you shall command your children to observe and to do , and to fulfil all that is written in this law :
For they are not commanded you in vain , but that every one should live in them , and that doing them you may continue a long time in the land whither you are going over the Jordan to possess it .
And the Lord spoke to Moses the same day , saying :
Go up into this mountain <unk> , ( that is to say , of <unk> , ) unto mount <unk> , which is in the land of Moab over against Jericho : and see the land of Chanaan , which I will deliver to the children of Israel to possess , and die thou in the mountain .
When thou art gone up into it thou shalt be gathered to thy people , as Aaron thy brother died in mount <unk> , and was gathered to his people :
Because you <unk> against me in the midst of the children of Israel , at the waters of contradiction , in Cades of the desert of Sin : and you did not sanctify me among the children of Israel .
Thou shalt see the land before thee , which I will give to the children of Israel , but thou shalt not enter into it .
Deuteronomy Chapter 33 Moses before his death blesseth the tribes of Israel .
This is the blessing , wherewith the man of God , Moses , blessed the children of Israel , before his death .
And he said : The Lord came from Sinai , and from Seir he rose up to us : he hath appeared from mount Pharan , and with him thousands of saints .
In his right hand a fiery law .
He hath loved the people , all the saints are in his hand : and they that approach to his feet , shall receive of his doctrine .
Moses commanded us a law , the inheritance of the multitude of Jacob .
He shall be king with the most right , the princes of the people , being assembled with the tribes of Israel .
Let Ruben live , and not die , and be he small in number .
This is the blessing of Juda .
Hear , O Lord , the voice of Juda , and bring him in unto his people : his hands shall fight for him , and he shall be his helper against his enemies .
To Levi also he said : Thy perfection , and thy doctrine be to thy holy man , whom thou hast proved in the temptation , and judged at the waters of contradiction : Holy man .... Aaron and his successors in the priesthood .
33 : 9 . Who hath said to his father , and to his mother : I do not know you ; and to his brethren : I know you not : and their own children they have not known .
These have kept thy word , and observed thy covenant , Who hath said , etc ....
It is the duty of the priestly tribe to <unk> God ’ s honour and service before all <unk> of flesh and blood : in such manner as to behave as strangers to their <unk> <unk> , when these would withdraw them from the business of their calling .
Thy judgments , O Jacob , and thy law , O Israel : they shall put incense in thy wrath and holocaust upon thy altar .
Bless , O Lord , his strength , and receive the works of his hands .
Strike the backs of his enemies , and let not them that hate him rise .
And to Benjamin he said : The best beloved of the Lord shall dwell confidently in him : as in a bride chamber shall he abide all the day long , and between his shoulders shall be rest .
Shall dwell , etc ....
This seems to <unk> to the temple being built in the confines of the tribe of Benjamin .
To Joseph also he said : Of the blessing of the Lord be his land , of the fruits of heaven , and of the dew , and of the deep that lieth beneath .
Of the fruits brought forth by the sun and by the moon .
Of the tops of the ancient mountains , of the fruits of the everlasting hills :
And of the fruits of the earth , and of the fulness thereof .
The blessing of him that appeared in the bush , come upon the head of Joseph , and upon the crown of the Nazarite among his brethren .
The Nazarite .... See the note on Gen. <unk> .
His beauty as of the <unk> of a bullock , his horns as the horns of a <unk> : with them shall he push the nations even to the ends of the earth .
These are the multitudes of Ephraim and these the thousands of Manasses .
And to Zabulon he said : Rejoice , O Zabulon , in thy going out ; and Issachar in thy tabernacles .
They shall call the people to the mountain : there shall they sacrifice the victims of justice .
Who shall suck as milk the abundance of the sea , and the hidden treasures of the <unk> .
And to Gad he said : Blessed be Gad in his breadth : he hath rested as a lion , and hath seized upon the arm and the top of the head .
And he saw his <unk> , that in his portion the teacher was laid up : who was with the princes of the people , and did the justices of the Lord , and his judgment with Israel .
He saw , etc ....
The <unk> of the tribe of Gad , to which this <unk> , was their having the <unk> Moses buried in their borders ; though the particular place was not known .
To Dan also he said : Dan is a young lion , he shall flow <unk> from Basan .
And To Nephtali he said : Nephtali shall enjoy abundance , and shall be full of the blessings of the Lord : he shall possess the sea and the south .
The sea ....
The lake of <unk> .
To Aser also he said : Let Aser be blessed with children , let him be acceptable to his brethren , and let him dip his foot in oil .
His <unk> shall be iron and brass .
As the days of thy youth , so also shall thy old age be .
There is no other god like the God of the <unk> : he that is <unk> upon the heaven is thy helper .
By his magnificence the clouds run hither and thither .
His dwelling is above , and <unk> are the everlasting arms : he shall cast out the enemy from before thee , and shall say : Be thou brought to nought .
<unk> are the everlasting arms ....
Though the dwelling of God be above in heaven , his arms are always stretched out to help us here below .
Israel shall dwell in safety , and alone .
The eye of Jacob in a land of corn and wine , and the heavens shall be <unk> with dew .
Blessed art thou , Israel : who is like to thee , O people , that art saved by the Lord ?
the shield of thy help , and the sword of thy glory : thy enemies shall deny thee , and thou shalt tread upon their necks .
Deuteronomy Chapter 34 Moses seeth the promised land , but is not suffered to go into it .
He dieth at the age of <unk> years .
God <unk> his body secretly , and all Israel mourn for him thirty days .
Josue , <unk> ( by <unk> of Moses ’ s hands ) with the spirit of God , <unk> .
But Moses , for his special <unk> with God , and for most wonderful miracles , is commended above all other prophets .
Then Moses went up from the plains of Moab upon mount <unk> , to the top of <unk> over against Jericho : and the Lord shewed him all the land of Galaad as far as Dan .
And all Nephtali , and the land of Ephraim and Manasses , and all the land of Juda unto the <unk> sea ,
And the south part , and the breadth of the plain of Jericho the city of palm trees as far as Segor .
And the Lord said to him : This is the land , for which I swore to Abraham , Isaac , and Jacob , saying : I will give it to thy seed .
Thou hast seen it with thy eyes , and shalt not pass over to it .
And Moses the servant of the Lord died there , in the land of Moab , by the commandment of the Lord : <unk> there ....
This last chapter of Deuteronomy , in which the death of Moses is related , was written by Josue , or by some of the prophets .
And he buried him in the valley of the land of Moab over against <unk> : and no man hath known of his sepulchre until this present day .
He buried him , viz .... by the ministry of angels , and would have the place of his burial to be unknown , lest the Israelites , who were so <unk> to idolatry , might worship him with divine honours .
Moses was a hundred and twenty years old when he died : his eye was not dim , neither were his teeth moved .
And the children of Israel mourned for him in the plains of Moab thirty days : and the days of their mourning in which they mourned Moses were ended .
And Josue the son of Nun was filled with the spirit of wisdom , because Moses had laid his hands upon him .
And the children of Israel obeyed him , and did as the Lord commanded Moses .
And there arose no more a prophet in Israel like unto Moses , whom the Lord knew face to face ,
In all the signs and wonders , which he sent by him , to do in the land of Egypt to Pharao , and to all his servants , and to his whole land ,
And all the mighty hand , and great miracles , which Moses did before all Israel .
THE BOOK OF <unk> This Book is called <unk> , because it contains the history of what passed under him , and according to the common opinion was written by him .
The Greeks call him Jesus : for Josue and Jesus in the Hebrew , are the same name , and have the same <unk> , viz . , A <unk> .
And it was not without a mystery that he who was to bring the people into the land of promise should have his name changed from <unk> ( for so he was called before , Num .
<unk> , ) to <unk> or JESUS , to give us to understand , that Moses by his law could only bring the people within sight of the promised inheritance , but that our Saviour JESUS was to bring us into it .
Josue Chapter 1 Josue , encouraged by the Lord , <unk> the people to prepare themselves to pass over the Jordan .
Now it came to pass after the death of Moses , the servant of the Lord , that the Lord spoke to Josue , the son of Nun , the minister of Moses , and said to him :
Moses my servant is dead : arise , and pass over this Jordan , thou and thy people with thee , into the land which I will give to the children of Israel .
I will deliver to you every place that the sole of your foot shall tread upon , as I have said to Moses .
From the desert , and from Libanus unto the great river Euphrates , all the land of the Hethites , unto the great sea toward the going down of the sun , shall be your border .
No man shall be able to resist you all the days of thy life : as I have been with Moses , so will I be with thee : I will not leave thee , nor forsake thee .
Take courage , and be strong : for thou shalt divide by lot to this people the land for which I swore to their fathers , that I would deliver it to them .
Take courage therefore , and be very valiant : that thou mayst observe and do all the law , which Moses my servant hath commanded thee : turn not from it to the right hand or to the left , that thou mayst understand all things which thou dost .
Let not the book of this law depart from thy mouth : but thou shalt meditate on it day and night , that thou mayst observe and do all things that are written in it : then shalt thou direct thy way , and understand it .
Behold I command thee , take courage , and be strong .
Fear not , and be not dismayed : because the Lord thy God is with thee in all things whatsoever thou shalt go to .
And Josue commanded the princes of the people , saying : Pass through the midst of the camp , and command the people , and say :
Prepare your victuals : for after the third day you shall pass over the Jordan , and shall go in to possess the land , which the Lord your God will give you .
And he said to the <unk> , and the <unk> , and the half tribe of Manasses :
Remember the word , which Moses the servant of the Lord commanded you , saying : The Lord your God hath given you rest , and all this land .
Your wives , and children ; and cattle , shall remain in the land which Moses gave you on this side of the Jordan : but pass you over armed before your brethren all of you that are strong of hand , and fight for them ,
Until the Lord give rest to your brethren , as he hath given you , and they also possess the land which the Lord your God will give them : and so you shall return into the land of your possession , and you shall dwell in it , which Moses the servant of the Lord gave you beyond the Jordan , toward the rising of the sun .
And they made answer to Josue , and said : All that thou hast commanded us , we will do : and whither soever thou shalt send us , we will go .
As we obeyed Moses in all things , so will we obey thee also : only be the Lord thy God with thee , as he was with Moses .
He that shall <unk> thy mouth , and not obey all thy words , that thou shalt command him , let him die : only take thou courage , and do manfully .
Josue Chapter 2 Two spies are sent to Jericho , who are received and <unk> by Rahab .
And Josue , the son of Nun , sent from <unk> two men , to spy secretly : and said to them : Go , and view the land , and the city of Jericho .
They went , and entered into the house of a woman that was a harlot , named Rahab , and lodged with her .
And it was told the king of Jericho , and was said : Behold there are men come in hither , by night , of the children of Israel , to spy the land .
And the king of Jericho sent to Rahab , saying : Bring forth the men that came to thee , and are entered into thy house : for they are spies , and are come to view all the land .
And the woman taking the men , hid them , and said : I confess they came to me , but I knew not whence they were :
And at the time of <unk> the gate in the dark , they also went out together .
I know not whither they are gone : pursue after them quickly , and you will overtake them .
But she made the men go up to the top of her house , and covered them with the <unk> of flax , which was there .
Now they that were sent , pursued after them , by the way that leadeth to the <unk> of the Jordan : and as soon as they were gone out , the gate was presently shut .
The men that were hid were not yet asleep , when behold the woman went up to them , and said :
I know that the Lord hath given this land to you : for the dread of you is fallen upon us , and all the inhabitants of the land have lost all strength .
We have heard that the Lord dried up the water of the Red Sea , at your going in , when you came out of Egypt : and what things you did to the two kings of the Amorrhites , that were beyond the Jordan , Sehon and Og whom you slew .
And at the hearing these things , we were affrighted , and our heart fainted away , neither did there remain any spirit in us , at your coming in : for the Lord your God he is God in heaven above , and in the earth beneath .
Now , therefore , swear ye to me by the Lord , that as I have shewed mercy to you , so you also will shew mercy to my father ’ s house : and give me a true token .
That you will save my father and mother , my brethren and sisters , and all things that are theirs , and deliver our souls from death .
They answered her : Be our lives for you unto death , only if thou betray us not .
And when the Lord shall have delivered us the land , we will shew thee mercy and truth .
Then she let them down with a cord out of a window : for her house joined close to the wall .
And she said to them : Get ye up to the mountains , lest perhaps they meet you as they return : and there lie ye hid three days , till they come back , and so you shall go on your way .
And they said to her : We shall be blameless of this oath , which thou hast made us swear ,
If , when we come into the land , this scarlet cord be a sign , and thou <unk> it in the window , by which thou hast let us down : and gather together thy father and mother , and brethren , and all thy kindred into thy house .
Whosoever shall go out of the door of thy house , his blood shall be upon his own head , and we shall be <unk> .
But the blood of all that shall be with thee in the house , shall light upon our head , if any man touch them .
But if thou wilt betray us , and utter this word abroad , we shall be <unk> of this oath , which thou hast made us swear .
And she answered : As you have spoken , so be it done : and sending them on their way , she hung the scarlet cord in the window .
But they went and came to the mountains , and stayed there three days , till they that pursued them were returned .
For having sought them through all the way , they found them not .
And when they were gone back into the city , the spies returned , and came down from the mountain : and passing over the Jordan , they came to Josue , the son of Nun , and told him all that <unk> them ,
And said : the Lord hath delivered all this land into our hands , and all the inhabitants thereof are overthrown with fear .
Josue Chapter 3 The river Jordan is <unk> dried up for the passage of the children of Israel .
And Josue rose before <unk> , and removed the camp : and they departed from <unk> , and came to the Jordan : he , and all the children of Israel , and they abode there for three days .
After which , the <unk> went through the midst of the camp ,
And began to proclaim : When you shall see the ark of the covenant of the Lord your God , and the priests of the race of Levi carrying it , rise you up also , and follow them as they go before :
And let there be between you and the ark the space of two thousand cubits : that you may see it afar off , and know which way you must go : for you have not gone this way before : and take care you come not near the ark .
And Josue said to the people : Be ye sanctified : for tomorrow the Lord will do wonders among you .
And he said to the priests : Take up the ark of the covenant , and go before the people .
And they obeyed his commands , and took it up , and walked before them .
And the Lord said to Josue : This day will I begin to exalt thee before Israel : that they may know that as I was with Moses , so I am with thee also .
And do thou command the priests , that carry the ark of the covenant , and say to them : When you shall have entered into part of the water of the Jordan , stand in it .
And Josue said to the children of Israel : Come hither , and hear the word of the Lord your God .
And again he said : By this you shall know , that the Lord , the living God , is in the midst of you , and that he shall destroy , before your sight , the Chanaanite and the Hethite , the Hevite and the Pherezite , the <unk> also , and the Jebusite , and the Amorrhite .
Behold , the ark of the covenant of the Lord of all the earth shall go before you into the Jordan .
Prepare ye twelve men of the tribes of Israel , one of every tribe .
And when the priests , that carry the ark of the Lord the God of the whole earth , shall set the <unk> of their feet in the waters of the Jordan , the waters that are beneath shall run down and go off : and those that come from above , shall stand together upon a heap .
So the people went out of their tents , to pass over the Jordan : and the priests that carried the ark of the covenant , went on before them .
And as soon as they came into the Jordan , and their feet were <unk> in part of the water , ( now the Jordan , it being harvest time , had filled the banks of its channel , )
The waters that came down from above stood in one place , and swelling up like a mountain , were seen afar off , from the city that is called <unk> , to the place of <unk> : but those that were beneath , ran down into the sea of the wilderness , ( which now is called the <unk> Sea ) until they wholly failed .
And the people marched over against Jericho : and the priests that carried the ark of the covenant of the Lord , stood girded upon the dry ground in the midst of the Jordan , and all the people passed over , through the channel that was dried up .
Josue Chapter 4 <unk> stones are taken out of the river to be set up for a monument of the miracle ; and other twelve are placed in the midst of the river .
And when they were passed over , the Lord said to Josue :
<unk> twelve men , one of every tribe :
And command them to take out of the midst of the Jordan , where the feet of the priests stood , twelve very hard stones , which you shall set in the place of the camp , where you shall pitch your tents this night .
And Josue called twelve men , whom he had chosen out of the children of Israel , one out of every tribe ,
And he said to them : Go before the ark of the Lord your God to the midst of the Jordan , and carry from thence every man a stone on your shoulders , according to the number of the children of Israel ,
That it may be a sign among you : and when your children shall ask you tomorrow , saying : What means these stones ?
You shall answer them : The waters of the Jordan ran off before the ark of the covenant of the Lord when it passed over the same : therefore were these stones set for a monument of the children of Israel forever .
The children of Israel therefore did as Josue commanded them , carrying out of the channel of the Jordan twelve stones , as the Lord had commanded him according to the number of the children of Israel unto the place wherein they camped , and there they set them .
And Josue put other twelve stones in the midst of the channel of the Jordan , where the priests stood that carried the ark of the covenant : and they are there until this present day .
Now the priests that carried the ark , stood in the midst of the Jordan , till all things were accomplished , which the Lord had commanded Josue to speak to the people , and Moses had said to him .
And the people made haste , and passed over .
And when they had all passed over , the ark also of the Lord passed over , and the priests went before the people .
The children of Ruben also , and Gad , and half the tribe of Manasses , went armed before the children of Israel , as Moses had commanded them .
And forty thousand fighting men by their troops and bands , marched through the plains and fields of the city of Jericho .
In that day the Lord magnified Josue in the sight of all Israel , that they should fear him , as they had feared Moses , while he lived .
And he said to him :
Command the priests , that carry the ark of the covenant , to come up out of the Jordan .
And he commanded them , saying : Come ye up out of the Jordan .
And when they that carried the ark of the covenant of the Lord , were come up , and began to tread on the dry ground , the waters returned into their channel , and ran as they were wont before .
And the people came up out of the Jordan , the tenth day of the first month , and camped in Galgal , over against the east side of the city of Jericho .
And the twelve stones , which they had taken out of the channel of the Jordan , Josue pitched in Galgal ,
And said to the children of Israel : When your children shall ask their fathers tomorrow , and shall say to them : What mean these stones ?
You shall teach them , and say : Israel passed over this Jordan through the dry channel ,
The Lord your God <unk> up the waters thereof in your sight , until you passed over :
As he had done before in the Red Sea , which he dried up till we passed through :
That all the people of the earth may learn the most mighty hand of the Lord , that you also may fear the Lord your God for ever .
Josue Chapter 5 The people are circumcised : they keep the pasch .
The manna <unk> .
An angel appeareth to Josue .
Now when all the kings of the Amorrhites , who dwelt beyond the Jordan , westward , and all the kings of Chanaan , who possessed the places near the great sea , had heard that the Lord had dried up the waters of the Jordan before the children of Israel , till they passed over , their heart failed them , and there remained no spirit in them , fearing the coming in of the children of Israel .
At that time the Lord said to Josue : Make thee <unk> of stone , and <unk> the second time the children of Israel .
The second time .... Not that such as had been circumcised before were to be circumcised again ; but that they were now to renew , and take up again the practice of circumcision ; which had been <unk> during their forty years ’ <unk> in the wilderness ; by reason of their being always uncertain when they should be obliged to march .
He did what the Lord had commanded , and he circumcised the children of Israel in the hill of the <unk> .
Now this is the cause of the second circumcision : All the people that came out of Egypt that were males , all the men fit for war , died in the desert , during the time of the long going about in the way :
Now these were all circumcised .
But the people that were born in the desert ,
<unk> the forty years of the journey in the wide wilderness , were uncircumcised : till all they were consumed that had not heard the voice of the Lord , and to whom he had sworn before , that he would not shew them the land flowing with milk and honey .
The children of these succeeded in the place of their fathers , and were circumcised by Josue : for they were uncircumcised even as they were born , and no one had circumcised them in the way .
Now after they were all circumcised , they remained in the same place of the camp , until they were healed .
And the Lord said to Josue : This day have I taken away from you the reproach of Egypt .
And the name of that place was called Galgal , until this present day .
And the children of Israel abode in Galgal , and they kept the phase , on the fourteenth day of the month at evening , in the plains of Jericho :
And they ate on the next day unleavened bread of the corn of the land , and <unk> of the same year .
And the manna ceased after they ate of the corn of the land , neither did the children of Israel use that food any more , but they ate of the corn of the present year of the land of Chanaan .
And when Josue was in the field of the city of Jericho , he lifted up his eyes , and saw a man standing over against him , holding a drawn sword , and he went to him , and said : Art thou one of ours , or of our adversaries ?
And he answered : No : but I am prince of the host of the Lord , and now I am come .
<unk> of the host of the Lord , etc .... St. Michael , who is called prince of the people of Israel , Dan .
<unk> .
Josue fell on his face to the ground .
And worshipping , said : What saith my lord to his servant ?
<unk> .... Not with divine honour , but with a <unk> <unk> of an inferior kind , <unk> to the dignity of his person .
<unk> , saith he , thy shoes from off thy feet : for the place <unk> thou <unk> is holy .
And Josue did as was commanded him .
Josue Chapter 6 After seven days ’ <unk> , the priests sounding the trumpets , the walls of Jericho fall down : and the city is taken and destroyed .
Now Jericho was close shut up and fenced , for fear of the children of Israel , and no man durst go out or come in .
And the Lord said to Josue : Behold I have given into thy hands Jericho , and the king thereof , and all the valiant men .
Go round about the city all ye fighting men once a day : so shall ye do for six days .
And on the seventh day the priests shall take the seven trumpets , which are used in the jubilee , and shall go before the ark of the covenant : and you shall go about the city seven times , and the priests shall sound the trumpets .
And when the voice of the trumpet shall give a longer and broken <unk> , and shall sound in your ears , all the people shall shout together with a very great shout , and the walls of the city shall fall to the ground , and they shall enter in every one at the place against which they shall stand .
Then Josue , the son of Nun , called the priests , and said to them : Take the ark of the covenant : and let seven other priests take the seven trumpets of the jubilee , and march before the ark of the Lord .
And he said to the people : Go , and compass the city , armed , <unk> before the ark of the Lord .
And when Josue had ended his words , and the seven priests <unk> the seven trumpets before the ark of the covenant of the Lord ,
And all the armed men went before , the rest of the common people followed the ark , and the sound of the trumpets was heard on all sides .
But Josue had commanded the people , saying : You shall not shout , nor shall your voice be heard , nor any word go out of your mouth : until the day come wherein I shall say to you : <unk> , and shout .
So the ark of the Lord went about the city once a day , and returning into the camp , abode there .
And Josue rising before day , the priests took the ark of the Lord ,
And seven of them seven trumpets , which are used in the jubilee : and they went before the ark of the Lord , walking and sounding the trumpets : and the armed men went before them , and the rest of the common people followed the ark , and they <unk> the trumpets .
And they went round about the city the second day once , and returned into the camp .
So they did six days .
But the seventh day , rising up early , they went about the city , as it was ordered , seven times .
And when in the seventh going about the priests sounded with the trumpets , Josue said to all Israel : <unk> : for the Lord hath delivered the city to you :
And let this city be an anathema , and all things that are in it , to the Lord .
Let only Rahab , the harlot , live , with all that are with her in the house : for she hid the messengers whom we sent .
But beware ye lest you touch ought of those things that are forbidden , and you be guilty of transgression , and all the camp of Israel be under sin , and be troubled .
But whatsoever gold or silver there shall be , or vessels of brass and iron , let it be consecrated to the Lord , laid up in his treasures .
So all the people making a shout , and the trumpets sounding , when the voice and the sound <unk> in the ears of the multitude , the walls forthwith fell down : and every man went up by the place that was over against him : and they took the city ,
And killed all that were in it , man and woman , young and old .
The oxen also , and the sheep , and the asses , they slew with the edge of the sword .
But Josue said to the two men that had been sent for spies : Go into the harlot ’ s house , and bring her out , and all things that are <unk> , as you assured her by oath .
And the young men went in , and brought out Rahab , and her parents , her brethren also , and all her goods , and her kindred , and made them to stay without the camp .
But they burned the city , and all things that were therein ; except the gold and silver , and vessels of brass and iron , which they consecrated unto the treasury of the Lord .
But Josue saved Rahab the harlot , and her father ’ s house , and all she had , and they dwelt in the midst of Israel until this present day : because she hid the messengers whom he had sent to spy out Jericho .
At that time , Josue made an <unk> , saying :
Cursed be the man before the Lord , that shall raise up and build the city of Jericho .
In his firstborn may he lay the foundation thereof , and in the last of his children set up its gates .
Cursed , etc .... Jericho , in the mystical sense , signifies iniquity : the sounding of the trumpets by the priests , the preaching of the word of God ; by which the walls of Jericho are thrown down , when sinners are converted ; and a dreadful curse will light on them who build them up again .
And the Lord was with Josue , and his name was <unk> throughout all the land .
Josue Chapter 7 For the sins of <unk> , the Israelites are defeated at Hai .
The <unk> is found out ; and stoned to death , and God ’ s wrath is turned from them .
But the children of Israel transgressed the commandment , and took to their own use of that which was <unk> .
For <unk> , the son of Charmi , the son of <unk> , the son of <unk> , of the tribe of Juda , took something of the anathema : and the Lord was angry against the children of Israel .
And when Josue sent men from Jericho against Hai , which is beside Bethaven , on the east side of the town of Bethel , he said to them : Go up , and view the country : and they fulfilled his command , and viewed Hai .
And returning , they said to him : Let not all the people go up , but let two or three thousand men go , and destroy the city : why should all the people be troubled in vain , against enemies that are very few ?
There went up therefore three thousand fighting men : who immediately turned their backs ,
And were defeated by the men of the city of Hai , and there fell of them six and thirty men : and the enemies pursued them from the gate as far as <unk> , and they slew them as they fled by the <unk> : and the heart of the people was struck with fear , and melted like water .
But Josue rent his garments , and fell flat on the ground , before the ark of the Lord , until the evening , both he and all the ancients of Israel : and they put dust upon their heads .
And Josue said : Alas , O Lord God , why wouldst thou bring this people over the river Jordan , to deliver us into the hand of the Amorrhite , and to destroy us ?
would God we had stayed beyond the Jordan , as we began .
My Lord God , what shall I say , seeing Israel turning their backs to their enemies ?
The Chanaanites , and all the inhabitants of the land , will hear of it , and being gathered together will <unk> us , and cut off our name from the earth : and what wilt thou do to thy great name ?
And the Lord said to Josue : Arise , why <unk> thou flat on the ground ?
Israel hath sinned , and transgressed my covenant : and they have taken of the anathema , and have stolen and lied , and have hid it among their goods .
Neither can Israel stand before his enemies , but he shall flee from them : because he is defiled with the anathema .
I will be no more with you , till you destroy him that is guilty of this wickedness .
Arise , sanctify the people , and say to them : Be ye sanctified against tomorrow : for thus saith the Lord God of Israel : The curse is in the midst of thee , O Israel : thou canst not stand before thy enemies , till he be destroyed out of thee , that is defiled with this wickedness .
And you shall come in the morning , every one by your tribes : and what tribe soever the lot shall find , it shall come by its kindreds , and the kindred by its houses and the house by the men .
And whosoever he be that shall be found guilty of this <unk> , he shall be burnt with fire , with all his substance , because he hath transgressed the covenant of the Lord , and hath done wickedness in Israel .
Josue , therefore , when he rose in the morning , made Israel to come by their tribes , and the tribe of Juda was found .
Which being brought by in families , it was found to be the family of <unk> .
<unk> that also by the houses , he found it to be <unk> :
And bringing his house man by man , he found <unk> , the son of Charmi , the son of <unk> , the son of <unk> , of the tribe of Juda .
And Josue said to <unk> : My son , give glory to the Lord God of Israel , and confess , and tell me what thou hast done , hide it not .
And <unk> answered Josue , and said to him : <unk> I have sinned against the Lord , the God of Israel , and thus and thus have I done .
For I saw among the spoils a scarlet garment , exceeding good , and two hundred sicles of silver , and a golden rule of fifty sicles : and I coveted them , and I took them away , and hid them in the ground in the midst of my tent , and the silver I covered with the earth that I dug up .
Josue therefore sent ministers : who running to his tent , found all hid in the same place , together with the silver .
And taking them away out of the tent , they brought them to Josue , and to all the children of Israel , and threw them down before the Lord .
Then Josue , and all Israel with him , took <unk> , the son of <unk> , and the silver , and the garment , and the golden rule , his sons also , and his daughters , his oxen , and asses , and sheep , the tent also , and all the goods : and brought them to the valley of <unk> : His sons , etc ....
<unk> <unk> to , or <unk> of , the crime of their father .
Where Josue said : Because thou hast troubled us , the Lord trouble thee this day .
And all Israel stoned him : and all things that were his , were consumed with fire .
And they gathered together upon him a great heap of stones , which remaineth until this present day And the wrath of the Lord was turned away from them .
And the name of that place was called the <unk> of <unk> , until this day .
<unk> .... That is , trouble .
Josue Chapter 8 Hai is taken and burnt , and all the inhabitants slain .
An altar is built , and sacrifices offered .
The law is written on stones , and the blessings and <unk> are read before all the people .
And the Lord said to Josue : Fear not , nor be thou dismayed : take with thee all the multitude of fighting men , arise , and go up to the town of Hai : Behold I have delivered into thy hand the king thereof , and the people , and the city , and the land .
And thou shalt do to the city of Hai , and to the king thereof , as thou hast done to Jericho , and to the king thereof : but the spoils , and all the cattle , you shall take for a prey to yourselves : lay an ambush for the city behind it .
And Josue arose , and all the army of the fighting men with him , to go up against Hai : and he sent thirty thousand chosen valiant men in the night ,
And commanded them , saying : Lay an ambush behind the city : and go not very far from it : and be ye all ready .
But I , and the rest of the multitude which is with me , will approach on the contrary side against the city .
And when they shall come out against us , we will flee , and turn our backs , as we did before :
Till they pursuing us be drawn farther from the city : for they will think that we flee as before .
And whilst we are fleeing , and they pursuing , you shall rise out of the ambush , and shall destroy the city : and the Lord your God will deliver it into your hands .
And when you shall have taken it , set it on fire , and you shall do all things so as I have commanded .
And he sent them away , and they went on to the place of the ambush , and abode between Bethel and Hai , on the west side of the city of Hai .
But Josue <unk> that night in the midst of the people ,
And rising early in the morning , he <unk> his soldiers , and went up with the ancients in the front of the army , <unk> with the aid of the fighting men .
And when they were come , and were gone up over against the city , they stood on the north side of the city , between which and them there was a valley in the midst .
And he had chosen five thousand men , and set them to lie in ambush between Bethel and Hai , on the west side of the same city : <unk> thousand ....
These were part of the thirty thousand mentioned above , ver .
3 .
But all the rest of the army went in battle array on the north side , so that the last of that multitude reached to the west side of the city .
So Josue went that night , and stood in the midst of the valley .
And when the king of Hai saw this , he made haste in the morning , and went out with all the army of the city , and set it in battle array , toward the desert , not knowing that there lay an ambush behind his back .
But Josue , and all Israel gave back , making as if they were afraid , and fleeing by the way of the wilderness .
But they shouting together , and <unk> one another , pursued them .
And when they were come from the city ,
And not one remained in the city of Hai and of Bethel , that did not pursue after Israel , leaving the towns open as they had rushed out ,
The Lord said to Josue : Lift up the shield that is in thy hand , towards the city of Hai , for I will deliver it to thee .
And when he had lifted up his shield towards the city , the ambush , that lay hid , rose up immediately : and going to the city , took it , and set it on fire .
And the men of the city , that pursued after Josue , looking back , and seeing the smoke of the city rise up to heaven , had no more power to flee this way or that way : especially as they that had <unk> flight , and were going toward the wilderness , turned back most <unk> against them that pursued .
So Josue , and all Israel , seeing that the city was taken , and that the smoke of the city rose up , returned , and slew the men of Hai .
And they also that had taken and set the city on fire , <unk> out of the city to meet their own men , began to cut off the enemies who were surrounded by them .
So that the enemies being cut off on both sides , not one of so great a multitude was saved .
And they took the king of the city of Hai alive and brought him to Josue .
So all being slain that had pursued after Israel , in his flight to the wilderness , and falling by the sword in the same place , the children of Israel returned and laid waste the city .
And the number of them that fell that day , both of men and women , was twelve thousand persons , all of the city of Hai .
But Josue drew not back his hand , which he had stretched out on high , holding the shield , till all the inhabitants of Hai were slain .
And the children of Israel divided among them , the cattle and the prey of the city , as the Lord had commanded Josue .
And he burnt the city , and made it a heap forever :
And he hung the king thereof on a gibbet , until the evening and the going down of the sun .
Then Josue commanded , and they took down his carcass from the gibbet : and threw it in the very entrance of the city , <unk> upon it a great heap of stones , which remaineth until this present day .
Then Josue built an altar to the Lord , the God of Israel , in Mount <unk> ,
As Moses , the servant of the Lord , had commanded the children of Israel , and it is written in the book of the law of Moses : an altar of <unk> stones , which iron had not touched : and he offered upon it holocausts to the Lord , and immolated victims of peace offerings .
And he wrote upon stones , the Deuteronomy of the law of Moses , which he had ordered before the children of Israel .
And all the people , and the ancients , and the princes , and judges , stood on both sides of the ark , before the priests that carried the ark of the covenant of the Lord , both the stranger and he that was born among them , half of them by Mount <unk> , and half by Mount <unk> , as Moses the servant of the Lord , had commanded .
And first he blessed the people of Israel .
After this , he read all the words of the blessing and the cursing , and all things that were written in the book of the law .
He left out nothing of those things which Moses had commanded , but he repeated all before all the people of Israel , with the women and children , and strangers , that dwelt among them .
Josue Chapter 9 Josue is deceived by the Gabaonites : who being <unk> are condemned to be perpetual servants .
Now when these things were heard of , all the kings beyond the Jordan , that dwelt in the mountains , and in the plains , in the places near the sea , and on the coasts of the great sea , they also that dwell by Libanus , the Hethite , and the Amorrhite , the Chanaanite , the Pherezite , and the Hevite , and the Jebusite ,
<unk> themselves together , to fight against Josue and Israel with one mind , and one resolution .
But they that dwelt in Gabaon , hearing all that Josue had done to Jericho and Hai :
<unk> <unk> took for themselves provisions , laying old sacks upon their asses , and wine bottles rent and <unk> up again ,
And very old shoes , which for a <unk> of age were <unk> with <unk> , and old garments upon them : the loaves also , which they carried for provisions by the way , were hard , and broken into pieces :
And they went to Josue , who then abode in the camp at Galgal , and said to him , and to all Israel with him : We are come from a far country , desiring to make peace with you .
And the children of Israel answered them , and said :
Perhaps you dwell in the land which <unk> to our lot ; if so , we can make no league with you .
But they said to Josue : We are thy servants .
Josue said to them : Who are you ?
and whence came you ?
They answered : From a very far country thy servants are come in the name of the Lord thy God .
For we have heard the fame of his power , all the things that he did in Egypt .
And to the two kings of the Amorrhites , that were beyond the Jordan , Sehon , king of Hesebon , and Og , king of Basan , that was in Astaroth :
And our ancients , and all the inhabitants of our country , said to us : Take with you victuals for a long way , and go meet them , and say : We are your servants , make ye a league with us .
Behold , these loaves we took hot , when we set out from our houses to come to you , now they are become dry , and broken in pieces by being exceeding old .
These bottles of wine when we filled them were new , now they are rent and burst .
These garments we have on , and the shoes we have on our feet , by reason of the very long journey , are <unk> out , and almost consumed .
They took therefore of their victuals , and consulted not the mouth of the Lord .
And Josue made peace with them , and entering into a league , promised that they should not be slain : the princes also of the multitude swore to them .
Now three days after the league was made , they heard that they dwelt nigh , and they should be among them .
And the children of Israel removed the camp , and came into their cities on the third day , the names of which are , Gabaon , and <unk> , and <unk> , and Cariathiarim .
And they slew them not , because the princes of the multitude had sworn in the name of the Lord , the God of Israel .
Then all the common people murmured against the princes .
And they answered them : We have sworn to them in the name of the Lord , the God of Israel , and therefore we may not touch them .
But this we will do to them : Let their lives be saved , lest the wrath of the Lord be stirred up against us , if we should be <unk> :
But so let them live , as to serve the whole multitude in <unk> wood , and bringing in water .
As they were speaking these things ,
Josue called the Gabaonites , and said to them : Why would you <unk> upon us , saying : We dwell very far off from you , whereas you are in the midst of us ?
Therefore you shall be under a curse , and your race shall always be <unk> of wood , and <unk> of water , into the house of my God .
They answered : It was told us , thy servants , that the Lord thy God had promised his servant Moses , to give you all the land , and to destroy all the inhabitants thereof .
Therefore we feared exceedingly and provided for our lives , compelled by the dread we had of you , and we took this counsel .
And now we are in thy hand : deal with us as it seemeth good and right unto thee .
So Josue did as he had said , and delivered them from the hand of the children of Israel , that they should not be slain .
And he gave orders in that day , that they should be in the service of all the people , and of the altar of the Lord , <unk> wood , and carrying water , until this present time , in the place which the Lord hath chosen .
Josue Chapter 10 <unk> kings war against Gabaon .
Josue <unk> them : many are slain with <unk> .
At the prayer of Josue the sun and moon stand still the space of one day .
The five kings are hanged .
<unk> cities are taken .
When <unk> , king of Jerusalem , had heard these things , to wit , that Josue had taken Hai , and had destroyed it , ( for as he had done to Jericho and the king thereof , so did he to Hai and its king ) and that the Gabaonites were gone over to Israel , and were their <unk> ,
He was exceedingly afraid .
For Gabaon was a great city , and one of the royal cities , and greater than the town of Hai , and all its fighting men were most valiant .
Therefore <unk> , king of Jerusalem , sent to <unk> , king of Hebron , and to <unk> , king of Jerimoth , and to <unk> , king of Lachis , and to Dabir , king of Eglon , saying :
Come up to me , and bring help , that we may take Gabaon , because it hath gone over to Josue , and to the children of Israel .
So the five kings of the Amorrhites being assembled together , went up : the king of Jerusalem , the king of Hebron , the king of Jerimoth , the king of Lachis , the king of Eglon , they and their armies , and camped about Gabaon , laying siege to it .
But the inhabitants of the city of Gabaon , which was besieged , sent to Josue , who then abode in the camp at Galgal , and said to him : <unk> not thy hands from <unk> thy servants : come up quickly , and save us , and bring us succour : for all the kings of the Amorrhites , who dwell in the mountains , are gathered together against us .
And Josue went up from Galgal , and all the army of the warriors with him , most valiant men .
But the Lord said to Josue : Fear them not : for I have delivered them into thy hands : none of them shall be able to stand against thee .
So Josue going up from Galgal all the night , came upon them suddenly .
And the Lord troubled them , at the sight of Israel : and he slew them with a great slaughter , in Gabaon , and pursued them by the way of the ascent to <unk> , and cut them off all the way to <unk> and <unk> .
And when they were fleeing from the children of Israel , and were in the <unk> of <unk> , the Lord cast down upon them great stones from heaven , as far as <unk> : and many more were killed with the <unk> , than were slain by the swords of the children of Israel ,
Then Josue spoke to the Lord , in the day that he delivered the Amorrhite in the sight of the children of Israel , and he said before them : <unk> not , O sun , toward Gabaon , nor thou , O moon , toward the valley of <unk> .
And the sun and the moon stood still , till the people revenged themselves of their enemies .
Is not this written in the book of the just ?
So the sun stood still in the midst of heaven , and <unk> not to go down the space of one day .
The book of the just ....
In Hebrew <unk> : an ancient book long since lost .
There was not before , nor after , so long a day , the Lord <unk> the voice of a man , and fighting for Israel .
And Josue returned , with all Israel , into the camp of Galgal .
For the five kings were fled , and had hid themselves in a cave of the city of <unk> .
And it was told Josue , that the five kings were found hid in a cave of the city of <unk> .
And he commanded them that were with him , saying : <unk> great stones to the mouth of the cave , and set careful men to keep them shut up :
And stay you not , but pursue after the enemies , and kill all the <unk> of them as they flee , and do not suffer them whom the Lord God hath delivered into your hands , to <unk> themselves in their cities .
So the enemies being slain with a great slaughter , and almost utterly consumed , they that were able to escape from Israel , entered into fenced cities .
And all the army returned to Josue , in <unk> , where the camp then was , in good health , and without the loss of any one : and no man durst move his tongue against the children of Israel .
And Josue gave orders , saying : Open the mouth of the cave , and bring forth to me the five kings that lie hid therein .
And the ministers did as they were commanded : and they brought out to him the five kings out of the cave : the king of Jerusalem , the king of Hebron , the king of Jerimoth , the king of Lachis , the king of Eglon .
And when they were brought out to him , he called all the men of Israel , and said to the chiefs of the army that were with him : Go , and set your feet on the necks of these kings .
And when they had gone , and put their feet upon the necks of them lying under them ,
He said again to them : Fear not , neither be ye dismayed , take courage , and be strong : for so will the Lord do to all your enemies , against whom you fight .
And Josue struck , and slew them , and hanged them upon five <unk> ; and they hung until the evening .
And when the sun was down , he commanded the soldiers to take them down from the <unk> .
And after they were taken down , they cast them into the cave , where they had <unk> hid , and put great stones at the mouth thereof , which remain until this day .
The same day Josue took <unk> , and destroyed it with the edge of the sword , and killed the king and all the inhabitants thereof : he left not in it the least remains .
And he did to the king of <unk> , as he had done to the king of Jericho .
And he passed from <unk> with all Israel to <unk> , and fought against it :
And the Lord delivered it with the king thereof into the hands of Israel : and they destroyed the city with the edge of the sword , and all the inhabitants thereof .
They left not in it any remains .
And they did to the king of <unk> , as they had done to the king of Jericho .
From <unk> he passed unto Lachis , with all Israel : and <unk> it with his army , besieged it .
And the Lord delivered Lachis into the hands of Israel , and he took it the following day , and put it to the sword , and every soul that was in it , as he had done to <unk> .
At that time <unk> , king of Gazer , came up to succour Lachis : and Josue slew him with all his people so as to leave none alive .
And he passed from Lachis to Eglon , and surrounded it ,
And took it the same day : and put to the sword all the souls that were in it , according to all that he had done to Lachis .
He went up also with all Israel from Eglon to Hebron , and fought against it :
<unk> it , and destroyed it with the edge of the sword : the king also thereof , and all the towns of that country , and all the souls that dwelt in it : he left not therein any remains : as he had done to Eglon , so did he also to Hebron , putting to the sword all that he found in it .
The king ....
Viz . , the new king , who succeeded him that was slain , ver .
26 .
<unk> from thence to Dabir ,
He took it , and destroyed it : the king also thereof , and all the towns round about , he destroyed with the edge of the sword : he left not in it any remains : as he had done to Hebron and <unk> , and to their kings , so did he to Dabir , and to the king thereof .
So Josue conquered all the country of the hills , and of the south , and of the plain , and of <unk> , with their kings : he left not any remains therein , but slew all that <unk> , as the Lord , the God of Israel , had commanded him .
<unk> remains therein , but slew , etc .... God ordered these people to be utterly destroyed , in punishment of their manifold abomination ; and that they might not draw the Israelites into the like sins .
From Cadesbarne even to Gaza .
All the land of <unk> even to Gabaon ,
And all their kings , and their lands he took and wasted at one <unk> : for the Lord the God of Israel fought for him .
And he returned with all Israel to the place of the camp in Galgal .
Josue Chapter 11 The kings of the north are overthrown : the whole country is taken .
And when <unk> king of Asor had heard these things , he sent to Jobab king of <unk> , and to the king of <unk> , and to the king of <unk> :
And to the kings of the north , that dwelt in the mountains and in the plains over against the south side of <unk> , and in the <unk> and the countries of <unk> by the sea side :
To the Chanaanites also on the east and on the west , and the Amorrhite , and the Hethite , and the Pherezite , and the Jebusite in the mountains : to the Hevite also who dwelt at the foot of Hermon in the land of Maspha .
And they all came out with their troops , a people exceeding numerous as the sand that is on the sea shore , their horses also and chariots a very great multitude ,
And all these kings assembled together at the waters of <unk> , to fight against Israel .
And the Lord said to Josue : Fear them not : for to morrow at this same hour I will deliver all these to be slain in the sight of Israel : thou shalt <unk> their horses , and thou shalt burn their chariots with fire .
<unk> their horses , and burn their chariots with fire , etc .... God so ordained , that his people might not trust in chariots and horses , but in him .
And Josue came , and all the army with him , against them to the waters of <unk> on a sudden , and fell upon them .
And the Lord delivered them into the hands of Israel .
And they defeated them , and <unk> them as far as the great Sidon and the waters of <unk> , and the field of <unk> , which is on the east thereof .
He slew them all , so as to leave no remains of them :
And he did as the Lord had commanded him , he <unk> their horses and burned their chariots .
And presently turning back he took Asor : and slew the king thereof with the sword .
Now Asor of old was the head of all these kingdoms .
And he cut off all the souls that abode there : he left not in it any remains , but utterly destroyed all , and burned the city itself with fire .
And he took and put to the sword and destroyed all the cities round about , and their kings , as Moses the servant of God had commanded him .
Except the cities that were on hills and high places , the rest Israel burned : only Asor that was very strong he consumed with fire .
And the children of Israel divided among themselves all the spoil of these cities and the cattle , killing all the men .
As the Lord had commanded Moses his servant , so did Moses command Josue , and he accomplished all : he left not one thing <unk> of all the commandments which the Lord had commanded Moses .
So Josue took all the country of the hills , and of the south , and the land of <unk> , and the plains and the west country , and the mountain of Israel , and the plains thereof :
And part of the mountain that goeth up to Seir as far as <unk> , by the plain of Libanus under mount Hermon : all their kings he took , smote and slew .
Josue made war a long time against these kings .
A long time ....
Seven years , as appears from chap .
<unk> .
There was not a city that delivered itself to the children of Israel , except the Hevite , who dwelt in Gabaon : for he took all by fight .
For it was the sentence of the Lord , that their hearts should be hardened , and they should fight against Israel , and fall , and should not deserve any clemency , and should be destroyed as the Lord had commanded Moses .
<unk> ....
This <unk> of their hearts , was their having no thought of yielding or <unk> : which was a sentence or judgment of God upon them in punishment of their <unk> crimes .
At that time Josue came and cut off the <unk> from the mountains , from Hebron , and Dabir , and <unk> , and from all the mountain of Juda and Israel , and destroyed their cities .
He left not any of the stock of the <unk> , in the land of the children of Israel : except the cities of Gaza , and Geth , and Azotus , in which alone they were left .
So Josue took all the land , as the Lord spoke to Moses , and delivered it in possession to the children of Israel , according to their divisions and tribes .
And the land rested from wars .
Josue Chapter 12 A <unk> of the kings slain by Moses and Josue ,
These are the kings , whom the children of Israel slew and possessed their land beyond the Jordan towards the rising of the sun , from the torrent Arnon unto mount Hermon , and all the east country that looketh towards the wilderness .
Sehon king of the Amorrhites , who dwelt in Hesebon , and had dominion from Aroer , which is <unk> upon the bank of the torrent Arnon , and of the middle part in the valley , and of half Galaad , as far as the torrent <unk> , which is the border of the children of Ammon .
And from the wilderness , to the sea of <unk> towards the east , and to the sea of the wilderness , which is the most salt sea , on the east side by the way that leadeth to <unk> : and on the south side that lieth under <unk> , <unk> .
The border of Og the king of Basan , of the remnant of the <unk> who dwelt in Astaroth , and in <unk> , and had dominion in mount Hermon , and in <unk> , and in all Basan , unto the borders
Of <unk> and <unk> , and of half Galaad : the borders of Sehon the king of Hesebon .
Moses the servant of the Lord , and the children of Israel slew them , and Moses delivered their land in possession to the <unk> , and <unk> , and the half tribe of Manasses .
These are the kings of the land , whom Josue and the children of Israel slew beyond the Jordan on the west side from <unk> in the field of Libanus , unto the mount , part of which goeth up into Seir : and Josue delivered it in possession to the tribes of Israel , to every one their divisions ,
As well in the mountains as in the plains and the <unk> countries .
In <unk> , and in the wilderness , and in the south was the Hethite and the Amorrhite , the Chanaanite and the Pherezite , the Hevite and the Jebusite .
The king of Jericho one : the king of Hai , which is on the side of Bethel , one :
The king of Jerusalem one , the king of Hebron one ,
The king of Jerimoth one , the king of Lachis one ,
The king of Eglon one , the king of Gazer one ,
The king of Dabir one , the king of <unk> one ,

The king of <unk> one , the king of Asor one ,
The king of <unk> one , the king of <unk> one ,
The king of <unk> one , the king of Mageddo one ,
The king of Cades one , the king of <unk> of Carmel one ,
The king of <unk> , and of the province of <unk> one , the king of the nations of Galgal one ,
The king of Thersa one : all the kings thirty and one .
Josue Chapter 13 God commandeth Josue to divide the land : the possessions of Ruben , Gad , and half the tribe of Manasses , beyond the Jordan .
Josue was old , and far advanced in years , and the Lord said to him : Thou art grown old , and advanced in age , and there is a very large country left , which is not yet divided by lot : Josue was old , and far advanced in years ....
He was then about one hundred and one years old . — And there is a very large country left , which is not yet divided by lot .... Not yet possessed by the children of Israel .
To wit , all Galilee , <unk> , and all <unk> .
From the troubled river , that <unk> Egypt , unto the border of Accaron <unk> : the land of Chanaan , which is divided among the lords of the Philistines , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , and the <unk> .
And on the south side are the <unk> , all the land of Chanaan , and <unk> of the Sidonians as far as <unk> , and the borders of the Amorrhite ,
And his confines .
The country also of Libanus towards the east from <unk> under mount Hermon to the entering into Emath .
Of all that dwell in the mountains from Libanus , to the waters of <unk> , and all the Sidonians .
I am he that will cut them off from before the face of the children of Israel .
So let their land come in as a part of the inheritance of Israel , as I have commanded thee .
And now divide the land in possession to the nine tribes , and to the half tribe of Manasses ,
With whom Ruben and Gad have possessed the land , which Moses the servant of the Lord delivered to them beyond the river Jordan , on the east side .
With whom .... That is , with the other half of that same tribe .
From Aroer , which is upon the bank of the torrent Arnon , and in the midst of the valley and all the plains of <unk> , as far as Dibon :
And all the cities of Sehon , king of the Amorrhites , who reigned in Hesebon , unto the borders of the children of Ammon .
And Galaad , and the borders of <unk> and <unk> , and all mount Hermon , and all Basan as far as <unk> ,
All the kingdom of Og in Basan , who reigned in Astaroth and <unk> , he was of the remains of the <unk> : and Moses overthrew and destroyed them .
And the children of Israel would not destroy <unk> and <unk> and they have dwelt in the midst of Israel , until this present day .
But to the tribe of Levi he gave no possession : but the sacrifices and victims of the Lord God of Israel , are his inheritance , as he spoke to him .
And Moses gave a possession to the children of Ruben according to their kindreds .
And their border was from Aroer , which is on the bank of the torrent Arnon , and in the midst of the valley of the same torrent : all the plain , that leadeth to <unk> ,
And Hesebon , and all their villages , which are in the plains .
Dibon also , and <unk> , and the town of <unk> ,
And <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> ,
And <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> in the mountain of the valley .
<unk> and <unk> , <unk> and <unk> ,
And all the cities of the plain , and all the kingdoms of Sehon king of the Amorrhites , that reigned in Hesebon , whom Moses slew with the princes of Madian : <unk> , and <unk> , and Sur and Hur , and <unk> , dukes of Sehon inhabitants of the land .
The princes of Madian ....
It appears from hence that these were subjects of king Sehon : they are said to have been slain with him , that is , about the same time , but not in the same battle .
Balaam also the son of Beor the <unk> , the children of Israel slew with the sword among the rest that were slain .
And the river Jordan was the border of the children of Ruben .
This is the possession of the <unk> , by their kindreds , of cities and villages .
And Moses gave to the tribe of Gad and to his children by their kindreds a possession , of which this is the division .
The border of <unk> , and all the cities of Galaad , and half the land of the children of Ammon : as far as Aroer which is over against <unk> :
And from Hesebon unto Ramoth , <unk> and <unk> : and from <unk> unto the borders of Dabir .
And in the valley <unk> and <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> the other part of the kingdom of Sehon king of Hesebon : the <unk> of this also is the Jordan , as far as the uttermost part of the sea of <unk> beyond the Jordan on the east side ,
This is the possession of the children of Gad by their families , their cities , and villages .
He gave also to the half tribe of Manasses and his children possession according to their kindreds ,
The beginning whereof is this : from <unk> all Basan , and all the kingdoms of Og king of Basan , and all the villages of Jair , which are in Basan , threescore towns .
And half Galaad , and Astaroth , and <unk> , cities of the kingdom of Og in Basan : to the children of Machir , the son of Manasses , to one half of the children of Machir according to their kindreds .
This possession Moses divided in the plains of Moab , beyond the Jordan , over against Jericho on the east side ,
But to the tribe of Levi he gave no possession : because the Lord the God of Israel himself is their possession , as he spoke to them .
Josue Chapter 14 Caleb ’ s petition ; Hebron is given to him and to his seed .
This is what the children of Israel possessed in the land of Chanaan , which Eleazar the priest , and Josue the son of Nun , and the princes of the families by the tribes of Israel gave to them .
<unk> all by lot , as the Lord had commanded by the hand of Moses , to the nine tribes , and the half tribe .
For to two tribes and a half Moses had given possession beyond the Jordan : besides the Levites , who received no land among their brethren :
But in their place succeeded the children of Joseph divided into two tribes , of Manasses and Ephraim : neither did the Levites receive other portion of land , but cities to dwell in , and their suburbs to feed their beasts and flocks .
Hebron belonged , etc .... All the country <unk> , <unk> on Hebron , was given to Caleb ; but the city itself with the suburbs , was one of those that were given to the priests to dwell in .
As the Lord had commanded Moses so did the children of Israel , and they divided the land .
Then the children of Juda came to Josue in Galgal , and Caleb the son of Jephone the <unk> spoke to him : Thou knowest what the Lord spoke to Moses the man of God concerning me and thee in Cadesbarne .
I was forty years old when Moses the servant of the Lord sent me from Cadesbarne , to view the land , and I brought him word again as to me seemed true ,
But my brethren , that had gone up with me , <unk> the heart of the people : and I nevertheless followed the Lord my God .
And Moses swore in that day , saying : The land which thy foot hath trodden upon shall be thy possession , and thy children ’ s for ever , because thou hast followed the Lord my God .
The Lord therefore hath granted me life , as he promised until this present day , It is forty and five years since the Lord spoke this word to Moses , when Israel <unk> through the wilderness : this day I am <unk> years old ,
As strong as I was at that time when I was sent to view the land : the strength of that time continueth in me until this day , as well to fight as to march .
Give me therefore this mountain , which the Lord promised , in thy hearing also , wherein are the <unk> , and cities great and strong : if so be the Lord will be with me , and I shall be able to destroy them , as he promised me .
And Josue blessed him , and gave him Hebron in possession .
And from that time Hebron belonged to Caleb the son of Jephone the <unk> , until this present day : because he followed the Lord the God of Israel .
The name of Hebron before was called <unk> : Adam the greatest among the <unk> was laid there and the land rested from wars .
Josue Chapter 15 The borders of the lot of Juda .
Caleb ’ s portion and <unk> .
The cities of Juda .
Now the lot of the children of Juda by their kindreds was this : From the <unk> of Edom , to the desert of Sin southward , and to the uttermost part of the south coast .
<unk> beginning was from the top of the most salt sea , and from the <unk> thereof , that looketh to the south .
And it goeth out towards the ascent of the <unk> , and passeth on to Sina : and <unk> into Cadesbarne , and <unk> into <unk> , going up to <unk> , and <unk> <unk> .
And from thence passing along into <unk> , and <unk> the torrent of Egypt : and the bounds thereof shall be the great sea , this shall be the <unk> of the south coast .
But on the east side the beginning shall be the most salt sea even to the end of the Jordan : and towards the north from the <unk> of the sea unto the same river Jordan .
And the border goeth up into <unk> , and passeth by the north into <unk> : going up to the stone of <unk> the son of Ruben .
And <unk> as far as the borders of <unk> from the valley of <unk> , and so <unk> looking towards Galgal , which is <unk> to the ascent of <unk> , on the south side of the torrent , and the border passeth the waters that are called the fountain of the sun : and the goings out thereof shall be at the fountain <unk> .
And it goeth up by the valley of the son of Ennom on the side of the Jebusite towards the south , the same is Jerusalem : and thence <unk> to the top of the mountain , which is over against <unk> to the west in the end of the valley of Raphaim , <unk> .
And it passeth on from the top of the mountain to the fountain of the water of <unk> : and <unk> to the towns of mount Ephron : and it <unk> towards <unk> , which is Cariathiarim , that is to say , the city of the woods .
And it <unk> from <unk> westward unto mount Seir : and passeth by the side of mount <unk> to the north into <unk> : and goeth down into Bethsames , and passeth into <unk> .
And <unk> <unk> to a part of Accaron at the side : and <unk> to <unk> , and passeth mount <unk> : and cometh into <unk> , and is <unk> westward with the great sea .
These are the borders round about of the children of Juda in their kindreds .
But to Caleb the son of Jephone he gave a portion in the midst of the children of Juda , as the Lord had commanded him : <unk> the father of <unk> , which is Hebron .
And Caleb destroyed out of it the three sons of <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , and <unk> of the race of <unk> .
And going up from thence he came to the inhabitants of Dabir , which before was called <unk> , that is to say , the city of letters .

Josue Chapter 16 The lot of the sons of Joseph .
The borders of the tribe of Ephraim .
And the lot of the sons of Joseph fell from the Jordan over against Jericho and the waters thereof , on the east : the wilderness which goeth up from Jericho to the mountain of Bethel :
And goeth out from Bethel to <unk> : and passeth the border of <unk> , to <unk> ,
And goeth down westward , by the border of <unk> , unto the borders of Beth-horon the <unk> , and to Gazer : and the countries of it are ended by the great sea :
And Manasses and Ephraim the children of Joseph possessed it .
And the border of the children of Ephraim was according to their kindreds : and their possession towards the east was <unk> unto Beth-horon the upper .
And the confines go out unto the sea : but <unk> looketh to the north , and it goeth round the borders eastward into <unk> : and passeth along on the east side to <unk> .
<unk> to the north , etc ....
The meaning is , that the border went towards the north , by <unk> ; and then turned eastward to <unk> .
And it goeth down from <unk> into <unk> and <unk> : and it cometh to Jericho , and goeth out to the Jordan .
From <unk> it passeth on towards the sea into the valley of reeds , and the goings out thereof are at the most salt sea .
This is the possession of the tribe of the children of Ephraim by their families .
And there were cities with their villages separated for the children of Ephraim in the midst of the possession of the children of Manasses .
And the children of Ephraim slew not the Chanaanite , who dwelt in Gazer : and the Chanaanite dwelt in the midst of Ephraim until this day , paying tribute .
Josue Chapter 17 The lot of the half tribe of Manasses .
And this lot fell to the tribe of Manasses for he is the firstborn of Joseph to Machir the firstborn of Manasses the father of Galaad , who was a <unk> man , and had for possession Galaad and Basan .
And to the rest of the children of Manasses according to their families : to the children of <unk> , and to the children of <unk> , and to the children of <unk> , and to the children of <unk> , and to the children of <unk> , and to the children of <unk> : these are the male children of Manasses the son of Joseph , by their kindreds .
But <unk> the son of <unk> the son of Galaad the son of Machir the son of Manasses had no sons , but only daughters : whose names are these , <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and Melcha and Thersa .
And they came in the presence of Eleazar the priest and of Josue the son of Nun , and of the princes , saying : The Lord commanded by the hand of Moses , that a possession should be given us in the midst of our brethren .
And he gave them according to the commandment of the Lord a possession amongst the brethren of their father .
And there fell ten portions to Manasses , beside the land of Galaad and Basan beyond the Jordan .
For the daughters of Manasses possessed inheritance in the midst of his sons .
And the land of Galaad fell to the lot of the rest of the children of Manasses .
And the border of Manasses was from Aser , <unk> which looketh towards Sichem : and it goeth out on the right hand by the inhabitants of the fountain of <unk> .
For the lot of Manasses took in the land of <unk> , which is on the borders of Manasses , and <unk> to the children of Ephraim .
And the border goeth down to the valley of the reeds , to the south of the torrent of the cities of Ephraim , which are in the midst of the cities of Manasses : the border of Manasses is on the north side of the torrent , and the <unk> of it are at the sea :
So that the possession of Ephraim is on the south , and on the north that of Manasses , and the sea is the border of both , and they are joined together in the tribe of Aser on the north , and in the tribe of Issachar on the east .
And the inheritance of Manasses in Issachar and in Aser , was Bethsan and its villages , and <unk> with its villages , and the inhabitants of <unk> , with the towns thereof : the inhabitants also of <unk> with the villages thereof : and in like manner the inhabitants of <unk> with the villages thereof : and the inhabitants of Mageddo with their villages , and the third part of the city of <unk> .
Neither could the children of Manasses overthrow these cities , but the Chanaanite began to dwell in his land .
But after that the children of Israel were grown strong , they subdued the Chanaanites , and made them their <unk> , and they did not kill them .
And the children of Joseph spoke to Josue , and said : Why hast thou given me but one lot and one portion to possess , whereas I am of so great a multitude , and the Lord hath blessed me ?
And Josue said to them : If thou be a great people , go up into the <unk> , and cut down room for thyself in the land of the Pherezite and the <unk> : because the possession of mount Ephraim is too narrow for thee .
And the children of Joseph answered him : We cannot go up to the mountains , for the Chanaanites that dwell in the low lands , wherein are situate Bethsan with its towns , and <unk> in the midst of the valley , have chariots of iron .
And Josue said to the house of Joseph , to Ephraim and Manasses : Thou art a great people , and of great strength , thou shalt not have one lot only :
But thou shalt pass to the mountain , and shalt cut down the wood , and make thyself room to dwell in : and mayst proceed farther , when thou hast destroyed the Chanaanites , who as thou sayest have iron chariots , and are very strong .
Josue Chapter 18 <unk> are sent to divide the rest of the land into seven tribes .

And all the children of Israel assembled together in Silo , and there they set up the tabernacle of the testimony , and the land was subdued before them .

And Josue said to them : How long are you <unk> and <unk> , and go not in to possess the land which the Lord the God of your fathers hath given you ?
<unk> of every tribe three men , that I may send them , and they may go and compass the land , and mark it out according to the number of each multitude : and bring back to me what they have <unk> out .
<unk> to yourselves the land into seven parts : let Juda be in his bounds on the south side , and the house of Joseph on the north .
The land in the midst between these mark ye out into seven parts ; and you shall come hither to me , that I may cast lots for you before the Lord your God .
The land in the midst between these mark ye out into seven parts .... That is to say , the rest of the land , which is not already <unk> to Juda or Joseph .
For the Levites have no part among you , but the priesthood of the Lord is their inheritance .
And Gad and Ruben , and the half tribe of Manasses have already received their possessions beyond the Jordan eastward : which Moses the servant of the Lord gave them .
And when the men were risen up , to go to mark out the land , Josue commanded them saying : Go round the land and mark it out , and return to me : that I may cast lots for you before the Lord in Silo .
So they went and <unk> it divided it into seven parts , writing them down in a book .
And they returned to Josue , to the camp in Silo .
And he cast lots before the Lord in Silo , and divided the land to the children of Israel into seven parts .
And first came up the lot of the children of Benjamin by their families , to possess the land between the children of Juda , and the children of Joseph .

And when he shall flee to one of these cities : he shall stand before the gate of the city , and shall speak to the ancients of that city , such things as prove him innocent : and so shall they receive him , and give him a place to dwell in .
And when the <unk> of blood shall pursue him , they shall not deliver him into his hands , because he slew his neighbour <unk> , and is not proved to have been his enemy two or three days before ,
And he shall dwell in that city , till he stand before judgment to give an account of his <unk> , and till the death of the high priest , who shall be at that time : then shall the <unk> return , and go into his own city and house from whence he fled .

Josue Chapter 22 The tribes of Ruben and Gad , and half the tribe of Manasses return to their possessions .
They build an altar by the side of the Jordan , which <unk> the other tribes .
An <unk> is sent to them , to which they give a <unk> answer .
At the same time Josue called the <unk> , and the <unk> , and the half tribe of Manasses ,
And said to them : You have done all that Moses the servant of the Lord commanded you : you have also obeyed me in all things ,
Neither have you left your brethren this long time , until this present day , keeping the commandment of the Lord your God .
Therefore as the Lord your God hath given your brethren rest and peace , as he promised : return , and go to your dwellings , and to the land of your possession , which Moses the servant of the Lord gave you beyond the Jordan :
Yet so that you observe <unk> , and in work fulfil the commandment and the law which Moses the servant of the Lord commanded you : that you love the Lord your God , and walk in all his ways , and keep all his commandments , and cleave to him , and serve him with all your heart , and with all your soul .
And Josue blessed them , and sent them away , and they returned to their dwellings .
Now to half the tribe of Manasses , Moses had given a possession in Basan : and therefore to the half that remained , Josue gave a lot among the rest of their brethren beyond the Jordan to the west .
And when he sent them away to their dwellings and had blessed them ,
He said to them : With much substance and riches , you return to your <unk> , with silver and gold , brass and iron , and variety of raiment : divide the prey of your enemies with your brethren .
So the children of Ruben , and the children of Gad , and the half tribe of Manasses returned , and <unk> from the children of Israel in Silo , which is in Chanaan , to go into Galaad the land of their possession , which they had obtained according to the commandment of the Lord by the hand of Moses .
And when they were come to the banks of the Jordan , in the land of Chanaan , they built an altar <unk> great near the Jordan .
And when the children of Israel had heard of it , and certain messengers brought them an account that the children of Ruben , and of Gad , and the half tribe of Manasses had built an altar in the land of Chanaan , upon the banks of the Jordan , over against the children of Israel :
They all assembled in Silo , to go up and fight against them .
And in the mean time they sent to them into the land of Galaad , Phinees the son of Eleazar the priest ,
And ten princes with him , one of every tribe .
22 : 15 . Who came to the children of Ruben , and of Gad , and the half tribe of Manasses , into the land of Galaad , and said to them :
Thus saith all the people of the Lord : What meaneth this transgression ?
Why have you forsaken the Lord the God of Israel , building a <unk> altar , and <unk> from the worship of him ?
Is it a small thing to you that you sinned with Beelphegor , and the <unk> of that crime remaineth in us to this day ?
and many of the people perished .
And you have forsaken the Lord to day , and to morrow his wrath will rage against all Israel .
But if you think the land of your possession to be unclean , pass over to the land wherein is the tabernacle of the Lord , and dwell among us : only depart not from the Lord , and from our society , by building an altar beside the altar of the Lord our God .
Did not <unk> the son of <unk> transgress the commandment of the Lord , and his wrath lay upon all the people of Israel ?
And he was but one man , and would to God he alone had perished in his wickedness .
And the children of Ruben , and of Gad , and of the half tribe of Manasses answered the princes of the <unk> of Israel :
The Lord the most mighty God , the Lord the most mighty God , he knoweth , and Israel also shall understand : If with the design of transgression we have set up this altar , let him not save us , but punish us immediately :
And if we did it with that mind , that we might lay upon it holocausts , and sacrifice , and victims of peace offerings , let him require and judge :
And not rather with this thought and design , that we should say : To morrow your children will say to our children : What have you to do with the Lord the God of Israel ?
The Lord hath put the river Jordan for a border between us and you , O ye children of Ruben , and ye children of Gad : and therefore you have no part in the Lord .
And by this occasion your children shall turn away our children from the fear of the Lord .
We therefore thought it best ,
And said : Let us build us an altar , not for holocausts , nor to offer victims ,
But for a testimony between us and you , and our posterity and yours , that we may serve the Lord , and that we may have a right to offer both holocausts , and victims and sacrifices of peace offerings : and that your children to morrow may not say to our children : You have no part in the Lord .
And if they will say so , they shall answer them : Behold the altar of the Lord , which our fathers made , not for holocausts , nor for sacrifice , but for a testimony between us and you .
God keep us from any such wickedness that we should revolt from the Lord , and leave off following his steps , by building an altar to offer holocausts , and sacrifices , and victims , beside the altar of the Lord our God , which is erected before his tabernacle .
And when Phinees the priest , and the princes of the <unk> , who were with him , had heard this , they were satisfied : and they <unk> most willingly the words of the children of Ruben , and Gad , and of the half tribe of Manasses ,
And Phinees the priest the son of Eleazar said to them : Now we know that the Lord is with us , because you are not guilty of this revolt , and you have delivered the children of Israel from the hand of the Lord .
And he returned with the princes from the children of Ruben and Gad , out of the land of Galaad , into the land of Chanaan , to the children of Israel , and brought them word again .
And the saying pleased all that heard it .
And the children of Israel praised God , and they no longer said that they would go up against them , and fight , and destroy the land of their possession .
And the children of Ruben , and the children of Gad called the altar which they had built , Our testimony , that the Lord is God .
Josue Chapter 23 Josue being old <unk> the people to keep God ’ s commandments : and to avoid <unk> and all society with the Gentiles for fear of being brought to idolatry .
And when a long time was passed , after that the Lord had given peace to Israel , all the nations round about being subdued , and Josue being now old , and far advanced in years :
Josue called for all Israel , and for the elders , and for the princes , and for the judges , and for the masters , and said to them : I am old , and far advanced in years ,
And you see all that the Lord your God hath done to all the nations round about , how he himself hath fought for you :
And now since he hath divided to you by lot all the land , from the east of the Jordan unto the great sea , and many nations yet remain :
The Lord your God will destroy them , and take them away from before your face , and you shall possess the land as he hath promised you .
Only take courage , and be careful to observe all things that are written in the book of the law of Moses : and turn not aside from them neither to the right hand nor to the left :
Lest after that you are come in among the Gentiles , who will remain among you , you should swear by the name of their gods , and serve them , and adore them :
But cleave ye unto the Lord your God , as you have done until this day .
And then the Lord God will take away before your eyes nations that are great and very strong , and no man shall be able to resist you .
One of you shall <unk> a thousand men of the enemies : because the Lord your God himself will fight for you , as he hath promised .
This only take care of with all diligence , that you love the Lord your God .
But if you will embrace the errors of these nations that dwell among you , and make <unk> with them , and join <unk> :
Know ye for a certainty that the Lord your God will not destroy them before your face , but they shall be a pit and a snare in your way , and a <unk> at your side , and <unk> in your eyes , till he take you away and destroy you from off this excellent land , which he hath given you .
Behold this day I am going into the way of all the earth , and you shall know with all your mind that of all the words which the Lord promised to perform for you , not one hath failed ,
Therefore as he hath fulfilled in deed , what he promised , and all things prosperous have come : so will he bring upon you all the evils he hath threatened , till he take you away and destroy you from off this excellent land , which he hath given you ,
When you shall have transgressed the covenant of the Lord your God , which he hath made with you , and shall have served strange gods , and adored them : then shall the indignation of the Lord rise up quickly and speedily against you , and you shall be taken away from this excellent land , which he hath delivered to you .
Josue Chapter 24 Josue <unk> the people , and <unk> the covenant between them and God .
His death and burial .
And Josue gathered together all the tribes of Israel in Sichem , and called for the ancients , and the princes and the judges , and the masters : and they stood in the sight of the Lord :
And he spoke thus to the people : Thus saith the Lord the God of Israel : Your fathers dwelt of old on the other side of the river , Thare the father of Abraham , and Nachor : and they served strange gods .
Of the river ....
The Euphrates .
And I took your father Abraham from the borders of Mesopotamia : and brought him into the land of Chanaan : and I multiplied his seed ,
And gave him Isaac : and to him again I gave Jacob and Esau .
And I gave to Esau mount Seir for his possession : but Jacob and his children went down into Egypt .
And I sent Moses and Aaron , and I struck Egypt with many signs and wonders .
And I brought you and your fathers out of Egypt , and you came to the sea : and the Egyptians pursued your fathers with chariots and horsemen , as far as the Red Sea .
And the children of Israel cried to the Lord : and he put darkness between you and the Egyptians , and brought the sea upon them , and covered them .
Your eyes saw all that I did in Egypt , and you dwelt in the wilderness a long time .
And I brought you into the land of the Amorrhite , who dwelt beyond the Jordan .
And when they fought against you , I delivered them into your hands , and you possessed their land , and slew them .
And Balac son of <unk> king of Moab arose and fought against Israel .
And he sent and called for Balaam son of Beor , to curse you :
And I would not hear him , but on the contrary I blessed you by him , and I delivered you out of his hand .
And you passed over the Jordan , and you came to Jericho .
And the men of that city fought against you , the Amorrhite , and the Pherezite , and the Chanaanite , and the Hethite , and the <unk> , and the Hevite , and the Jebusite : and I delivered them into your hands .
And I sent before you <unk> : and I drove them out from their places , the two kings of the Amorrhites , not with thy sword nor with thy bow ,
And I gave you a land , in which you had not laboured , and cities to dwell in which you built not , vineyards and <unk> , which you planted not .
Now therefore fear the Lord , and serve him with a perfect and most sincere heart : and put away the gods which your fathers served in Mesopotamia and in Egypt , and serve the Lord .
But if it seem evil to you to serve the Lord , you have your choice : choose this day that which pleaseth you , whom you would rather serve , whether the gods which your fathers served in Mesopotamia , or the gods of the Amorrhites , in whose land you dwell : but as for me and my house we will serve the Lord ,
And the people answered , and said , God forbid we should leave the Lord , and serve strange gods .
The Lord our God he brought us and our fathers out of the land of Egypt , out of the house of bondage : and did very great signs in our sight , and preserved us in all the way by which we <unk> , and among all the people through whom we passed .
And he hath cast out all the nations , the Amorrhite the inhabitant of the land into which we are come .
Therefore we will serve the Lord , for he is our God .
And Josue said to the people : You will not be able to serve the Lord : for he is a holy God , and mighty and jealous , and will not forgive your wickedness and sins .
You will not be able to serve the Lord , etc ....
This was not said by way of <unk> them ; but rather to make them more earnest and <unk> , by setting before them the greatness of the <unk> , and the courage and constancy necessary to go through with it .
If you leave the Lord , and serve strange gods , he will turn , and will afflict you , and will destroy you after all the good he hath done you .
And the people said to Josue : No , it shall not be so as thou sayest , but we will serve the Lord .
And Josue said to the people , You are witnesses , that you yourselves have chosen you the Lord to serve him .
And they answered : We are witnesses .
Now therefore , said he , put away strange gods from among you , and incline your hearts to the Lord the God of Israel .
And the people said to Josue : We will serve the Lord our God , and we will be obedient to his commandments .
Josue therefore on that day made a covenant , and set before the people commandments and judgments in Sichem .
And he wrote all these things in the volume of the law of the Lord : and he took a great stone , and set it under the oak that was in the sanctuary of the Lord .
And he said to all the people : Behold this stone shall be a testimony unto you , that it hath heard all the words of the Lord , which he hath spoken to you : lest perhaps hereafter you will deny it , and lie to the Lord your God .
It hath heard ....
This is a figure of speech , by which <unk> is <unk> to <unk> things ; and they are called upon , as it were , to bear witness in favour of the great Creator , whom they on their part <unk> obey .
And he sent the people away every one to their own possession ,
And after these things Josue the son of Nun the servant of the Lord died , being a hundred and ten years old : And after , etc ....
If Josue wrote this book , as is commonly believed , these last verses were added by Samuel , or some other prophet .
And they buried him in the border of his possession in <unk> , which is situate in mount Ephraim , on the north side of mount <unk> .
And Israel served the Lord all the days of Josue , and of the ancients that lived a long time after Josue , and that had known all the works of the Lord which he had done in Israel .
And the bones of Joseph which the children of Israel had taken out of Egypt , they buried in Sichem , in that part of the field which Jacob had bought of the sons of Hemor the father of Sichem , for a hundred young <unk> , and it was in the possession of the sons of Joseph .
Eleazar also the son of Aaron died : and they buried him in <unk> that belongeth to Phinees his son , which was given him in mount Ephraim .
THE BOOK OF <unk> This Book is called <unk> , because it contains the history of what passed under the government of the judges , who ruled Israel before they had kings .
The writer of it , according to the more general opinion , was the prophet Samuel .
Judges Chapter 1 The <unk> and victory of Juda against the Chanaanites : who are <unk> in many places .
After the death of Josue , the children of Israel consulted the Lord , saying : Who shall go up before us against the Chanaanite , and shall be the leader of the war ?
And the Lord said : Juda shall go up : behold I have delivered the land into his hands .
And Juda said to Simeon , his brother : Come up with me into my lot , and fight against the Chanaanite , that I also may go along with thee into thy lot .
And Simeon went with him .
And Juda went up , and the Lord delivered the Chanaanite , and the Pherezite into their hands : and they slew of them in <unk> ten thousand men .
And they found <unk> in <unk> , and fought against him , and they defeated the Chanaanite , and the Pherezite .
And <unk> fled : and they pursued after him and took him , and cut off his fingers and <unk> .
And <unk> said : <unk> kings , having their fingers and <unk> cut off , gathered up the <unk> of the meat under my table : as I have done , so hath God <unk> me .
And they brought him to Jerusalem , and he died there .
And the children of Juda besieging Jerusalem , took it , and put it to the sword , and set the whole city on fire .
Jerusalem ....
This city was divided into two ; one part was called <unk> , the other <unk> : the one was in the tribe of Juda , the other in the tribe of Benjamin .
After it was taken and burnt by the men of Juda , it was quickly rebuilt again by the Jebusites , as we may gather from ver .
21 ; and continued in their possession till it was taken by king David .
And afterwards they went down and fought against the Chanaanite , who dwelt in the mountains , and in the south , and in the plains .
And Juda going forward against the Chanaanite , that dwelt in Hebron , ( the name whereof was in former times <unk> ) slew <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> : Hebron ....
This <unk> against Hebron , etc .
is the same as is related , Jos .
<unk> .
It is here repeated , to give the reader at once a short <unk> of all the <unk> of the tribe of Juda against the Chanaanites .
And departing from thence , he went to the inhabitants of Dabir , the ancient name of which was <unk> , that is , the city of letters .
The city of letters .... Perhaps so called from some famous <unk> , or <unk> , kept there .
And Caleb said : He that shall take <unk> , and lay it waste , to him will I give my daughter <unk> to wife .
And <unk> , the son of Cenez , the younger brother of Caleb , having taken it , he gave him <unk> his daughter to wife .
And as she was going on her way , her husband admonished her to ask a field of her father .
And as she <unk> sitting on her ass , Caleb said to her : What <unk> thee ?
But she answered : Give me a blessing , for thou hast given me a dry land : give me also a <unk> land So Caleb gave her the upper and the <unk> <unk> ground .
And the children of the Cinite , the kinsman of Moses , went up from the city of <unk> , with the children of Juda , into the wilderness of his lot , which is at the south side of <unk> , and they dwelt with him .
The Cinite .... Jethro the father in law of Moses was called <unk> , or the Cinite ; and his children who came along with the children of Israel <unk> themselves among them in the land of Chanaan , <unk> their worship and religion .
From these the Rechabites sprung , of whom see Jer .
35 . — Ibid .
The city of <unk> .... Jericho , so called from the abundance of palm trees .
And Juda went with Simeon , his brother , and they together defeated the Chanaanites that dwelt in <unk> , and slew them .
And the name of the city was called <unk> , that is , <unk> .
And Juda took Gaza , with its confines , and Ascalon , and Accaron , with their confines .
Gaza , etc ....
These were three of the principal cities of the Philistines , famous both in sacred and profane history .
They were taken at this time by the Israelites : but as they took no care to put <unk> in them , the Philistines soon recovered them .
And the Lord was with Juda , and he possessed the hill country : but was not able to destroy the inhabitants of the valley , because they had many chariots armed with <unk> .
Was not able , etc ....
Through a <unk> fear of their chariots armed with <unk> and <unk> , and for want of confidence in God .
And they gave Hebron to Caleb , as Moses had said , who destroyed out of it the three sons of <unk> .
But the sons of Benjamin did not destroy the Jebusites that inhabited Jerusalem : and the Jebusite hath dwelt with the sons of Benjamin in Jerusalem until this present day .
The house of Joseph also went up against Bethel , and the Lord was with them .
For when they were besieging the city , which before was called <unk> ,
They saw a man coming out of the city , and they said to him : Shew us the entrance into the city , and we will shew thee mercy .
And when he had shewed them , they smote the city with the edge of the sword : but that man , and all his kindred , they let go : 1 : 26 . Who being sent away , went into the land of <unk> , and built there a city , and called it <unk> : which is so called until this day .
Manasses also did not destroy Bethsan , and <unk> , with their villages ; nor the inhabitants of <unk> , and <unk> , and Mageddo , with their villages .
And the Chanaanite began to dwell with them .
But after Israel was grown strong , he made them <unk> , and would not destroy them .
Ephraim also did not slay the Chanaanite that dwelt in Gazer , but dwelt with him .
Zabulon destroyed not the inhabitants of <unk> , and <unk> : but the Chanaanite dwelt among them , and became their <unk> .
Aser also destroyed not the inhabitants of <unk> , and of Sidon , of <unk> , and of <unk> , and of <unk> , and of <unk> , and of Rohob :
And he dwelt in the midst of the Chanaanites , the inhabitants of that land , and did not slay them .
Nephthali also destroyed not the inhabitants of Bethsames , and of <unk> : and he dwelt in the midst of the Chanaanites , the inhabitants of the land , and the <unk> and <unk> were <unk> to him .

And he dwelt in the mountain <unk> , that is , of <unk> , in <unk> and <unk> .
And the hand of the house of Joseph was heavy upon him , and he became <unk> to him .
He dwelt .... That is , the Amorrhite .
And the border of the Amorrhite was from the ascent of the <unk> , the rock , and the higher places .
Judges Chapter 2 An angel reproveth Israel .
They weep for their sins .
After the death of Josue , they often fall , and <unk> are delivered from their afflictions , but still fall worse and worse .
And an angel of the Lord went up from Galgal to the place of <unk> , and said : I made you go out of Egypt , and have brought you into the land for which I swore to your fathers : and I promised that I would not make void my covenant with you for ever : An angel ....
<unk> the shape of a man .
On condition that you should not make a league with the inhabitants of this land , but should throw down their altars : and you would not hear my voice : why have you done this ?
Wherefore I would not destroy them from before your face ; that you may have enemies , and their gods may be your ruin .
And when the angel of the Lord spoke these words to all the children of Israel : they lifted up their voice , and wept .
And the name of that place was called , The place of <unk> , or of tears : and there they offered sacrifices to the Lord .
And Josue sent away the people , and the children of Israel went every one to his own possession to hold it : And Josue , etc ....
This is here <unk> out of Jos .
24 , by way of <unk> of what had happened before , and by way of an <unk> to that which follows .
And they served the Lord all his days , and the days of the ancients , that lived a long time after him , and who knew all the works of the Lord , which he had done for Israel .
And Josue , the son of Nun , the servant of the Lord , died , being a hundred and ten years old ;
And they buried him in the borders of his possession in <unk> , in Mount Ephraim , on the north side of Mount <unk> .
And all that generation was gathered to their fathers : and there arose others that knew not the Lord and the works which he had done for Israel .
And the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the Lord , and they served Baalim ,
And they left the Lord , the God of their fathers , who had brought them out of the land of Egypt : and they followed strange gods , and the gods of the people that dwelt round about them , and they adored them : and they provoked the Lord to anger , They followed strange gods .... What is here said of the children of Israel , as to their falling so often into idolatry , is to be understood of a great part of them ; but not so <unk> , as if the true worship of God was ever quite abolished among them : for the <unk> of the true church and religion was kept up all this time by the priests and Levites , at least in the house of God in Silo .
<unk> him , and serving Baal and Astaroth
And the Lord being angry against Israel , delivered them into the hands of <unk> : who took them and sold them to their enemies , that dwelt round about : neither could they stand against their enemies :
But whithersoever they meant to go , the hand of the Lord was upon them , as he had said , and as he had sworn to them : and they were greatly <unk> .
And the Lord raised up judges , to deliver them from the hands of those that oppressed them : but they would not hearken to them ,
<unk> fornication with strange gods , and adoring them .
They quickly forsook the way , in which their fathers had walked : and hearing the commandments of the Lord , they did all things contrary .
And when the Lord raised them up judges , in their days , he was moved to mercy , and heard the <unk> of the afflicted , and delivered them from the slaughter of the <unk> .
But after the judge was dead , they returned , and did much worse things than their fathers had done , following strange gods , serving them , and adoring them .
They left not their own inventions , and the stubborn way , by which they were accustomed to walk .
And the wrath of the Lord was kindled against Israel , and he said : Behold this nation hath made void my covenant , which I had made with their fathers , and hath despised to hearken to my voice :
I also will not destroy the nations which Josue left when he died :
That through them I may try Israel , whether they will keep the way of the Lord , and walk in it , as their fathers kept it , or not .
The Lord therefore left all these nations , and would not quickly destroy them , neither did he deliver them into the hands of Josue .
Judges Chapter 3 The people falling into idolatry are oppressed by their enemies ; but <unk> are delivered by <unk> , Aod , and <unk> .
These are the nations which the Lord left , that by them he might instruct Israel , and all that had not known the wars of the Chanaanites :
That afterwards their children might learn to fight with their enemies , and to be <unk> up to war :
The five princes of the Philistines , and all the Chanaanites , and the Sidonians , and the <unk> that dwelt in Mount Libanus , from Mount Baal Hermon to the entering into Emath .
And he left them , that he might try Israel by them , whether they would hear the commandments of the Lord , which he had commanded their fathers , by the hand of Moses , or not .
So the children of Israel dwelt in the midst of the Chanaanite , and the Hethite , and the Amorrhite , and the Pherezite , and the Hevite , and the Jebusite :
And they took their daughters to wives , and they gave their own daughters to their sons , and they served their gods .
And they did evil in the sight of the Lord , and they forgot their God , and served Baalim and Astaroth .
And the Lord being angry with Israel , delivered them into the hands of <unk> <unk> , king of Mesopotamia , and they served him eight years .
Mesopotamia ....
In Hebrew <unk> .
Syria of the two rivers : so called because it lies between the Euphrates and the <unk> .
It is <unk> called Syria , ver .
10 .
And they cried to the Lord , who raised them up a saviour , and delivered them ; to wit , <unk> , the son of Cenez , the younger brother of Caleb :
And the spirit of the Lord was in him , and he judged Israel .
And he went out to fight , and the Lord delivered into his hands <unk> <unk> , king of Syria , and he overthrew him :
And the land rested forty years , and <unk> , the son of Cenez , died .
And the children of Israel did evil again in the sight of the Lord : who strengthened against them Eglon , king of Moab : because they did evil in his sight .
And he joined to him the children of Ammon , and Amalec : and he went and overthrew Israel , and possessed the city of palm trees .
And the children of Israel served Eglon , king of Moab , eighteen years .
And afterwards they cried to the Lord , who raised them up a saviour , called Aod , the son of <unk> , the son of Jemini , who used the left hand as well as the right .
And the children of Israel sent presents to Eglon , king of Moab , by him .
And he made himself a <unk> sword , with a <unk> in the midst of the length of the palm of the hand , and was girded therewith , under his garment , on the right thigh .
And he presented the gifts to Eglon , king of Moab Now Eglon was exceeding fat .
And when he had presented the gifts unto him he followed his companions that came along with him .
Then returning from Galgal , where the idols were , he said to the king : I have a secret <unk> to thee , O king .
And he commanded silence : and all being gone out that were about him ,
Aod went in to him : now he was sitting in a summer <unk> alone , and he said : I have a word from God to thee .
And he forthwith rose up from his throne .
A word from God , etc .... What Aod , who was judge and chief <unk> of Israel , did on this occasion , was by a special <unk> of God : but such things are not to be <unk> by private men .
And Aod put forth his left hand , and took the <unk> from his right thigh , and thrust it into his belly ,
With such force that the <unk> went in after the <unk> into the wound , and was closed up with the abundance of fat .
So that he did not draw out the <unk> , but left it in the body as he had struck it in : and forthwith , by the secret parts of nature , the <unk> of the belly came out .
And Aod carefully <unk> the doors of the <unk> , and <unk> them ,
<unk> out by a <unk> door .
And the king ’ s servants going in , saw the doors of the <unk> shut , and they said : Perhaps he is <unk> nature in his summer <unk> .
And waiting a long time , till they were ashamed , and seeing that no man opened the door , they took a key : and opening , they found their lord lying dead on the ground .
But Aod , while they were in confusion , escaped , and passed by the place of the idols from whence he had returned .
And he came to <unk> :
And forthwith he sounded the trumpet in Mount Ephraim : and the children of Israel went down with him , he himself going in the front .
And he said to them : Follow me : for the Lord hath delivered our enemies , the Moabites , into our hands .
And they went down after him , and seized upon the <unk> of the Jordan , which are in the way to Moab : and they suffered no man to pass over :
But they slew of the Moabites at that time , about ten thousand , all strong and valiant men : none of them could escape .
And Moab was humbled that day under the hand of Israel : and the land rested eighty years .
After him was <unk> , the son of <unk> , who slew of the Philistines six hundred men with a <unk> : and he also <unk> Israel .
Judges Chapter 4 Debbora and Barac deliver Israel from <unk> and Sisara , <unk> killeth Sisara .
And the children of Israel again did evil in the sight of the Lord after the death of Aod :
And the Lord delivered them up into the hands of <unk> , king of Chanaan , who reigned in Asor : and he had a general of his army named Sisara , and he dwelt in <unk> of the Gentiles .
And the children of Israel cried to the Lord : for he had nine hundred chariots set with <unk> and for twenty years had grievously oppressed them .
And there was at that time Debbora , a <unk> , the wife of <unk> , who judged the people .
And she sat under a palm tree , which was called by her name , between Rama and Bethel , in Mount Ephraim : and the children of Israel came up to her for all judgment .
And she sent and called Barac , the Son of <unk> , out of <unk> , in Nephthali : and she said to him : The Lord God of Israel hath commanded thee : Go , and lead an army to Mount Thabor , and thou shalt take with thee ten thousand fighting men of the children of Nephthali , and of the children of Zabulon :
And I will bring unto thee in the place of the torrent <unk> , Sisara , the general of <unk> ’ s army , and his chariots , and all his multitude , and will deliver them into thy hand .
And Barac said to her : If thou wilt come with me , I will go : if thou wilt not come with me , I will not go .
She said to him : I will go , indeed , with thee , but at this time the victory shall not be <unk> to thee , because Sisara shall be delivered into the hand of a woman .
Debbora therefore arose , and went with Barac to <unk> .
And he called unto him Zabulon and Nephthali , and went up with ten thousand fighting men , having Debbora in his company .
Now <unk> , the Cinite , had some time before departed from the rest of the <unk> , his brethren , the sons of <unk> , the kinsman of Moses : and had pitched his tents unto the valley , which is called <unk> , and was near <unk> .
And it was told Sisara , that Barac , the son of <unk> , was gone up to Mount Thabor :
And he gathered together his nine hundred chariots armed with <unk> , and all his army , from <unk> of the Gentiles , to the torrent <unk> .
And Debbora said to Barac : Arise , for this is the day wherein the Lord hath delivered Sisara into thy hands : behold , he is thy leader .
And Barac went down from Mount Thabor , and ten thousand fighting men with him .
And the Lord struck a terror into Sisara , and all his chariots , and all his multitude , with the edge of the sword , at the sight of Barac ; insomuch , that Sisara <unk> down from off his chariot , fled away on foot ,
And Barac pursued after the fleeing chariots , and the army , unto <unk> of the Gentiles ; and all the multitude of the enemies was utterly destroyed .
But Sisara fleeing , came to the tent of <unk> , the wife of <unk> , the Cinite , for there was peace between <unk> , the king of Asor , and the house of <unk> , the Cinite .
And <unk> went forth to meet Sisara , and said to him : Come in to me , my lord ; come in , fear not .
He went into her tent , and being covered by her with a cloak ,
Said to her : Give me , I beseech thee , a little water , for I am very thirsty .
She opened a bottle of milk , and gave him to drink , and covered him .
And Sisara said to her : Stand before the door of the tent , and when any shall come and inquire of thee , saying : Is there any man here ?
thou shalt say : There is none .
So <unk> , <unk> ’ s wife , took a nail of the tent , and taking also a <unk> : and going in <unk> , and with silence , she put the nail upon the temples of his head , and striking it with the <unk> , drove it through his <unk> fast into the ground : and so passing from deep sleep to death , he fainted away and died .
And behold , Barac came pursuing after Sisara : and <unk> went out to meet him , and said to him : Come , and I will shew thee the man whom thou <unk> .
And when he came into her tent , he saw Sisara lying dead , and the nail fastened in his temples .
So God that day humbled <unk> , the king of Chanaan , before the children of Israel : 4 : 24 . Who grew daily stronger , and with a mighty hand <unk> <unk> , king of Chanaan , till they quite destroyed him .
Judges Chapter 5 The canticle of Debbora and Barac after their victory .
In that day Debbora and Barac , son of <unk> , sung , and said :
O you of Israel , that have willingly offered your lives to danger , bless the Lord .
Hear , O ye kings , give ear , O ye princes : It is I , it is I , that will sing to the Lord , I will sing to the Lord , the God of Israel .
O Lord , when thou <unk> out of Seir , and <unk> by the <unk> of Edom , the earth trembled , and the heavens and clouds <unk> water .
The mountains melted before the face of the Lord , and Sinai before the face of the Lord the God of Israel .
In the days of <unk> , the son of <unk> , in the days of <unk> , the paths rested : and they that went by them , walked through <unk> .
The paths rested ....
The ways to the sanctuary of God were <unk> : and men walked in the <unk> of error and sin .
The valiant men ceased , and rested in Israel : until Debbora arose , a mother arose in Israel .
The Lord chose new wars , and he himself overthrew the gates of the enemies : a shield and spear was not seen among forty thousand of Israel .
My heart loveth the princes of Israel : O you , that of your own good will offered yourselves to danger , bless the Lord .
Speak , you that <unk> upon fair asses , and you that sit in judgment , and walk in the way .
Where the chariots were <unk> together , and the army of the enemies was <unk> , there let the justices of the Lord be <unk> , and his clemency towards the <unk> men of Israel : then the people of the Lord went down to the gates , and obtained the <unk> .
Arise , arise , O Debbora , arise , arise , and utter a canticle .
Arise , Barac , and take hold of thy captives , O son of <unk> .
The remnants of the people are saved , the Lord hath fought among the valiant ones .
Out of Ephraim he destroyed them into Amalec , and after him out of Benjamin into thy people , O Amalec : Out of Machir there came down princes , and out of Zabulon they that led the army to fight .
Out of Ephraim , etc ....
The enemies <unk> in their flight were destroyed , as they were running through the land of Ephraim , and of Benjamin , which lies after , that is beyond Ephraim : and so on to the very confines of Amalec .
Or , it alludes to former victories of the people of God , particularly that which was <unk> in memory , when the men of Ephraim and Benjamin , with Aod at their head , overthrew their enemies the Moabites with the Amalecites their <unk> .

Perhaps he is now <unk> the spoils , and the <unk> of the women is chosen out for him : garments of divers colours are given to Sisara for his prey , and furniture of different kinds is <unk> together to adorn necks .
So let all thy enemies perish , O Lord : but let them that love thee shine , as the sun shineth in his rising .
And the land rested for forty years .
Judges Chapter 6 The people for their sins , are oppressed by the Madianites .
Gedeon is called to deliver them .
And the children of Israel again did evil in the sight of the Lord : and he delivered them into the hand of Madian seven years ,
And they were grievously oppressed by them .
And they made themselves dens and <unk> in the mountains , and strong holds to resist .
And when Israel had sown , Madian and Amalec , and the rest of the <unk> nations , came up :
And <unk> their tents among them , wasted all things as they were in the <unk> , even to the entrance of Gaza : and they left nothing at all in Israel for <unk> of life , nor sheep , nor oxen , nor asses .
For they and all their flocks came with their tents , and like locusts filled all places , an innumerable multitude of men , and of camels , <unk> whatsoever they touched .
And Israel was humbled exceedingly in the sight of Madian .
And he cried to the Lord , desiring help against the Madianites .
And he sent unto them a prophet , and he spoke : Thus saith the Lord , the God of Israel : I made you to come up out of Egypt , and brought you out of the house of bondage ,
And delivered you out of the hands of the Egyptians , and of all the enemies that afflicted you : and I cast them out at your coming in , and gave you their land .
And I said : I am the Lord your God , fear not the gods of the Amorrhites , in whose land you dwell .
And you would not hear my voice .
And an angel of the Lord came , and sat under an oak that was in <unk> , and belonged to Joas , the father of the family of <unk> .
And when Gedeon , his son , was <unk> and cleansing wheat by the winepress , to flee from Madian ,
The angel of the Lord appeared to him , and said : The Lord is with thee , O most valiant of men .
And Gedeon said to him : I beseech thee , my lord , if the Lord be with us , why have these evils fallen upon us ?
Where are his miracles , which our fathers have told us of , saying : The Lord brought us out of Egypt but now the Lord hath forsaken us , and delivered us into the hand of Madian .
And the Lord looked upon him , and said : Go , in this thy strength , and thou shalt deliver Israel out of the hand of Madian : know that I have sent thee .
He answered , and said : I beseech thee , my lord wherewith shall I deliver Israel ?
Behold , my family is the meanest in Manasses , and I am the least in my father ’ s house .
The meanest in Manasses , etc .... Mark how the Lord <unk> the humble ( who are mean and little in their own eyes ) for the greatest <unk> .
And the Lord said to him : I will be with thee : and thou shalt cut off Madian as one man .
And he said : If I have found grace before thee , give me a sign that it is thou that speakest to me :
And depart not hence , till I return to thee , and bring a sacrifice , and offer it to thee .
And he answered : I will wait thy coming .
So Gedeon went in , and boiled a kid , and made unleavened loaves of a measure of flour : and putting the flesh in a basket , and the <unk> of the flesh into a pot , he carried all under the oak , and presented to him .
And the angel of the Lord said to him : Take the flesh and the unleavened loaves , and lay them upon that rock , and pour out the <unk> thereon .
And when he had done so ,
The angel of the Lord put forth the tip of the rod , which he held in his hand , and touched the flesh and the unleavened loaves : and there arose a fire from the rock , and consumed the flesh and the unleavened loaves : and the angel of the Lord <unk> out of his sight .
And Gedeon seeing that it was the angel of the Lord , said : Alas , my Lord God : for I have seen the angel of the Lord face to face .
And the Lord said to him : Peace be with thee : fear not , thou shalt not die .
And Gedeon built there an altar to the Lord , and called it the Lord ’ s peace , until this present day .
And when he was yet in <unk> , which is of the family of <unk> ,
That night the Lord said to him : Take a bullock of thy father ’ s , and another bullock of seven years , and thou shalt destroy the altar of Baal , which is thy father ’ s : and cut down the grove that is about the altar :
And thou shalt build an altar to the Lord thy God , in the top of this rock , <unk> thou didst lay the sacrifice before : and thou shalt take the second bullock , and shalt offer a holocaust upon a <unk> of the wood , which thou shalt cut down out of the grove .
Then Gedeon , taking ten men of his servants , did as the Lord had commanded him .
But fearing his father ’ s house , and the men of that city , he would not do it by day , but did all by night .
And when the men of that town were risen in the morning , they saw the altar of Baal destroyed , and the grove cut down , and the second bullock laid upon the altar , which then was built .
And they said one to another : Who hath done this ?
And when they inquired for the author of the <unk> , it was said : Gedeon , the son of Joas , did all this .
And they said to Joas : Bring out thy son hither , that he may die : because he hath destroyed the altar of Baal , and hath cut down his grove .
He answered them : Are you the <unk> of Baal , that you fight for him ?
he that is his adversary , let him die before to morrow light appear : if he be a god , let him revenge himself on him that hath cast down his altar .
From that day Gedeon was called Jerobaal , because Joas had said : Let Baal revenge himself on him that hath cast down his altar .
Now all Madian , and Amalec , and the <unk> people , were gathered together , and passing over the Jordan , camped in the valley of <unk> .
But the spirit of the Lord came upon Gedeon , and he sounded the trumpet , and called together the house of <unk> , to follow him .
And he sent messengers into all Manasses , and they also followed him : and other messengers into Aser and Zabulon , and Nephthali , and they came to meet him .
And Gedeon said to God : If thou wilt save Israel by my hand , as thou hast said ,
I will put this <unk> of wool on the floor : if there be dew on the <unk> only , and it be dry on all the ground beside , I shall know that by my hand , as thou hast said , thou wilt deliver Israel .
And it was so .
And rising before day , <unk> the <unk> , he filled a vessel with the dew .
And he said again to God : Let not thy wrath be kindled against me , if I try once more , seeking a sign in the <unk> .
I pray that the <unk> only may be dry , and all the ground <unk> with dew .
And God did that night as he had requested : and it was dry on the <unk> only , and there was dew on all the ground .
Judges Chapter 7 Gedeon , with three hundred men , by <unk> <unk> the Madianites .
Then Jerobaal , who is the same as Gedeon , rising up early , and all the people with him , came to the fountain that is called <unk> .
Now the camp of Madian was in the valley , on the north side of the high hill .
And the Lord said to Gedeon : The people that are with thee are many , and Madian shall not be delivered into their hands : lest Israel should glory against me , and say : I was delivered by my own strength .
Lest Israel , etc .... By this we see that God will not choose for his instruments in great <unk> , which <unk> <unk> on his grace , such as , through pride and self <unk> , will take the glory to themselves .
Speak to the people , and proclaim in the hearing of all : Whosoever is fearful and <unk> , let him return .
So two and twenty thousand men went away from Mount Galaad and returned home , and only ten thousand remained .
And the Lord said to Gedeon : The people are still too many , bring them to the waters , and there I will try them : and of whom I shall say to thee , This shall go with thee , let him go : whom I shall forbid to go , let him return .
And when the people were come down to the waters , the Lord said to Gedeon : They that shall <unk> the water with their tongues , as dogs are wont to <unk> , thou shalt set apart by themselves : but they that shall drink bowing down their knees , shall be on the other side .
And the number of them that had <unk> water ; casting it with the hand to their mouth , was three hundred men : and all the rest of the multitude had drunk <unk> .
And the Lord said to Gedeon : By the three hundred men , that <unk> water , I will save you , and deliver Madian into thy hand : but let all the rest of the people return to their place .
That <unk> water ....
These were preferred that took the water up in their hands , and so <unk> it , before them who laid themselves quite down to the waters to drink : which <unk> a more <unk> and sensual disposition .
So taking victuals and trumpets according to their number , he ordered all the rest of the multitude to depart to their tents : and he with the three hundred gave himself to the battle .
Now the camp of <unk> was beneath him in the valley .
The same night the Lord said to him : Arise , and go down into the camp : because I have delivered them into thy hand .
But if thou be afraid to go alone , let <unk> , thy servant , go down with thee .
And when thou shalt hear what they are saying , then shall thy hands be strengthened , and thou shalt go down more secure to the enemies ’ camp .
And he went down with <unk> his servant , into part of the camp , where was the watch of men in arms .
But Madian and Amalec , and all the <unk> people , lay scattered in the valley , as a multitude of locusts : their camels also were innumerable , as the sand that lieth on the sea shore .
And when Gedeon was come , one told his neighbour a dream : and in this manner related what he had seen : I <unk> a dream , and it seemed to me as if a hearth <unk> of barley bread rolled and came down into the camp of Madian : and when it was come to a tent , it struck it , and beat it down flat to the ground .
A dream ....
<unk> of dreams is commonly <unk> , and as such is condemned in the word of God : but in some <unk> <unk> , as we here see , God is pleased by dreams to <unk> what he is about to do .
He to whom he spoke , answered : This is nothing else but the sword of Gedeon , the son of Joas , a man of Israel .
For the Lord hath delivered Madian , and all their camp into his hand .
And when Gedeon had heard the dream , and the interpretation thereof , he adored : and returned to the camp of Israel , and said : Arise , for the Lord hath delivered the camp of Madian into our hands .
And he divided the three hundred men into three parts , and gave them trumpets in their hands , and empty <unk> , and lamps within the <unk> .
And he said to them : What you shall see me do , do you the same : I will go into one part of the camp , and do you as I shall do .
When the trumpet shall sound in my hand , do you also blow the trumpets on every side of the camp , and shout together to the Lord and to Gedeon .
And Gedeon , and the three hundred men that were with him , went into part of the camp , at the beginning of the midnight watch , and the watchmen being <unk> , they began to sound their trumpets , and to <unk> the <unk> one against another .
Their trumpets , etc ....
In a mystical sense , the <unk> of the gospel , in order to spiritual <unk> , must not only sound with the trumpet of the word of God , but must also break their earthen <unk> , by the <unk> of the flesh and its <unk> , and carry lamps in their hands by the light of their virtues .
And when they sounded their trumpets in three places round about the camp , and had broken their <unk> , they held their lamps in their left hands , and with their right hands the trumpets which they <unk> , and they cried out : The sword of the Lord and of Gedeon :
<unk> every man in his place round about the enemies ’ camp .
So all the camp was troubled , and crying out and howling , they fled away :
And the three hundred men nevertheless <unk> sounding the trumpets .
And the Lord sent the sword into all the camp , and they killed one another ,
<unk> as far as <unk> , and the border of <unk> , in <unk> .
But the men of Israel , shouting from Nephthali , and Aser , and from all Manasses , pursued after Madian .
And Gedeon sent messengers into all Mount Ephraim , saying : Come down to meet Madian , and take the waters before them to <unk> and the Jordan .
And all Ephraim shouted , and took the waters before them and the Jordan as far as <unk> .
And having taken two men of Madian , <unk> and <unk> : <unk> they slew in the rock of <unk> , and <unk> in the winepress of <unk> .
And they pursued Madian , carrying the heads of <unk> and <unk> to Gedeon , beyond the waters of the Jordan .
Two men .... That is , two of their chiefs .
Judges Chapter 8 Gedeon <unk> the <unk> .
<unk> Zebee and Salmana .
<unk> Soccoth and Phanuel .
<unk> to be king .
<unk> an ephod of the gold of the prey , and dieth in a good old age .
The people return to idolatry .
And the men of Ephraim said to him : What is this that thou meanest to do , that thou wouldst not call us , when thou <unk> to fight against Madian ?
And they <unk> him <unk> , and almost offered violence .
And he answered them : What could I have done like to that which you have done ?
Is not one <unk> of grapes of Ephraim better than the <unk> of <unk> ?
What could I , etc .... A meek and humble answer appeased them ; who otherwise might have come to <unk> .
So great is the power of humility both with God and man .
The Lord hath delivered into your hands the princes of Madian , <unk> and <unk> : what could I have done like to what you have done ?
And when he had said this , their spirit was appeased , with which they <unk> against him .
And when Gedeon was come to the Jordan , he passed over it with the three hundred men that were with him : who were so weary that they could not pursue after them that fled .
And he said to the men of Soccoth : Give , I beseech you , bread to the people that is with me , for they are faint : that we may pursue Zebee , and Salmana , the kings of Madian .
The princes of Soccoth answered : <unk> the <unk> of the hands of Zebee and Salmana are in thy hand , and therefore thou <unk> that we should give bread to thy army .
And he said to them : When the Lord therefore shall have delivered Zebee and Salmana into my hands , I will <unk> your flesh with the thorns and briers of the desert .
And going up from thence , he came to Phanuel : and he spoke the like things to the men of that place .
And they also answered him , as the men of Soccoth had answered .
He said , therefore , to them also : When I shall return a <unk> in peace , I will destroy this tower .
But Zebee and Salmana were resting with all their army .
For fifteen thousand men were left of all the troops of the <unk> people , and one hundred and twenty thousand warriors that drew the sword were slain .
And Gedeon went up by the way of them that dwelt in tents , on the east of Nobe and <unk> , and smote the camp of the enemies , who were secure , and <unk> no hurt .
And Zebee and Salmana fled , and Gedeon pursued and took them , all their host being put in confusion .
And returning from the battle before the sun rising ,
He took a boy of the men of Soccoth : and he asked him the names of the princes and ancients of Soccoth , and he described unto him <unk> men .
And he came to Soccoth , and said to them : Behold Zebee , and Salmana , concerning whom you <unk> me , saying : <unk> the hands of Zebee and Salmana are in thy hands , and therefore thou <unk> that we should give bread to the men that are weary and faint .
So he took the ancients of the city , and thorns and briers of the desert , and <unk> them with the same , and cut in pieces the men of Soccoth .
And he <unk> the tower of Phanuel , and slew the men of the city .
And he said to Zebee and Salmana : What manner of men were they , whom you slew in Thabor ?
They answered : They were like thee , and one of them as the son of a king .
He answered them : They were my brethren , the sons of my mother .
As the Lord liveth , if you had saved them , I would not kill you .
And he said to Jether , his eldest son : Arise , and slay them .
But he drew not his sword : for he was afraid , being but yet a boy .
And Zebee and Salmana said : Do thou rise and run upon us : because the strength of a man is according to his age : Gedeon rose up , and slew Zebee and Salmana : and he took the ornaments and <unk> , with which the necks of the camels of kings are wont to be adorned .
And all the men of Israel said to Gedeon : <unk> thou over us , and thy son , and thy son ’ s son : because thou hast delivered us from the hand of Madian .
And he said to them : I will not rule over you , neither shall my son rule over you , but the Lord shall rule over you .
And he said to them : I desire one request of you : Give me the <unk> of your spoils .
For the <unk> were accustomed to wear golden <unk> .
They answered : We will give them most willingly .
And spreading a mantle on the ground , they cast upon it the <unk> of the spoils .
And the weight of the <unk> that he requested , was a thousand seven hundred sicles of gold , besides the ornaments , and <unk> , and purple raiment , which the kings of Madian were wont to use , and besides the golden chains that were about the camels necks .
And Gedeon made an ephod thereof , and put it in his city <unk> .
And all Israel committed fornication with it , and it became a ruin to Gedeon , and to all his house .
An ephod .... A priestly garment which Gedeon made with a good design ; but the Israelites , after his death , abused it by making it an instrument of their <unk> worship .
But Madian was humbled before the children of Israel , neither could they any more lift up their heads : but the land rested for forty years , while Gedeon <unk> .
So Jerobaal , the son of Joas , went and dwelt in his own house :
And he had seventy sons , who came out of his thigh , for he had many wives .
And his concubine , that he had in Sichem , bore him a son , whose name was Abimelech .
His concubine .... She was his servant , but not his harlot : and is called his concubine , as wives of an inferior <unk> are commonly called in the Old Testament , though otherwise <unk> married .
And Gedeon , the son of Joas died in a good old age , and was buried in the sepulchre of his father , in <unk> , of the family of <unk> .
But after Gedeon was dead , the children of Israel turned again , and committed fornication with Baalim .
And they made a covenant with Baal , that he should be their god :
And they remembered not the Lord their God , who delivered them out of the hands of all their enemies round about :
Neither did they shew mercy to the house of Jerobaal Gedeon , according to all the good things he had done to Israel .
Judges Chapter 9 Abimelech killeth his brethren .
Joatham ’ s parable .
Gaal <unk> with the <unk> against Abimelech , but is overcome .
Abimelech destroyeth Sichem : but is killed at <unk> .
And Abimelech , the son of Jerobaal , went to Sichem , to his mother ’ s brethren , and spoke to them , and to all the kindred of his mother ’ s father , saying :
Speak to all the men of Sichem : whether is better for you that seventy men , all the sons of Jerobaal , should rule over you , or that one man should rule over you ?
And withal , consider that I am your bone , and your flesh .
And his mother ’ s brethren spoke of him to all the men of Sichem , all these words , and they inclined their hearts after Abimelech , saying : He is our brother :
And they gave him seventy weight of silver out of the temple of <unk> : wherewith he hired to himself men that were needy , and <unk> , and they followed him .
<unk> .... That is , Baal of the covenant , so called from the covenant they had made with Baal , chap .
<unk> .
And he came to his father ’ s house in <unk> , and slew his brethren , the sons of Jerobaal , seventy men , upon one stone : and there remained only Joatham , the youngest son of Jerobaal , who was hidden .
And all the men of Sichem were gathered together , and all the families of the city of Mello : and they went and made Abimelech king , by the oak that stood in Sichem .
This being told to Joatham , he went , and stood on the top of Mount <unk> : and lifting up his voice , he cried , and said : Hear me , ye men of Sichem , so may God hear you .
The trees went to anoint a king over them : and they said to the olive tree : <unk> thou over us .
And it answered : Can I leave my fatness , which both gods and men make use of , to come to be <unk> among the trees ?
Both gods and men make use of ....
The olive tree is <unk> , speaking in this manner , because oil was used both in the worship of the true God , and in that of the false gods , whom the <unk> served .
And the trees said to the fig tree : Come thou and reign over us .
And it answered them : Can I leave my sweetness , and my <unk> fruits , and go to be <unk> among the other trees ?
And the trees said to the vine : Come thou and reign over us .
And it answered them : Can I forsake my wine , that <unk> God and men , and be <unk> among the other trees ?
<unk> God and men .... Wine is here <unk> as agreeable to God , because he had appointed it to be offered up with his sacrifices .
But we are not obliged to take these words , spoken by the trees , in Joatham ’ s parable , according to the <unk> <unk> sense : but only in a sense <unk> to the design of the parable expressed in the <unk> of it .
And all the trees said to the <unk> : Come thou and reign over us .
And it answered them : If , indeed , you mean to make me king , come ye , and rest under my shadow : but if you mean it not , let fire come out from the <unk> , and devour the cedars of Libanus .
Now , therefore , if you have done well , and without sin , in <unk> Abimelech king over you , and have dealt well with Jerobaal , and with his house , and have made a <unk> return for the benefits of him who fought for you ,
And exposed his life to dangers , to deliver you from the hand of Madian ,
And you are now risen up against my father ’ s house , and have killed his sons , seventy men , upon one stone , and have made Abimelech , the son of his handmaid , king over the inhabitants of Sichem , because he is your brother :
If therefore you have dealt well , and without fault , with Jerobaal and his house , rejoice ye , this day , in Abimelech , and may he rejoice in you .
But if unjustly : let fire come out from him , and consume the inhabitants of Sichem , and the town of Mello : and let fire come out from the men of Sichem and from the town of Mello , and devour Abimelech .
And when he had said thus , he fled , and went into <unk> : and dwelt there for fear of Abimelech , his brother .
So Abimelech reigned over Israel three years .
And the Lord sent a very evil spirit between Abimelech and the inhabitants of Sichem ; who began to <unk> him ,
And to lay the crime of the murder of the seventy sons of Jerobaal , and the shedding of their blood , upon Abimelech , their brother , and upon the rest of the princes of the <unk> , who <unk> him .
And they set an ambush against him on the top of the mountains : and while they waited for his coming , they committed <unk> , taking spoils of all that passed by : and it was told Abimelech .
And Gaal , the son of Obed , came with his brethren , and went over to Sichem .
And the inhabitants of Sichem , taking courage at his coming ,
<unk> out into the fields , <unk> the vineyards , and <unk> down the grapes : and singing and <unk> , they went into the temple of their god , and in their <unk> and cups they cursed Abimelech .
And Gaal , the son of Obed , cried : Who is Abimelech , and what is Sichem , that we should serve him ?
Is he not the son of Jerobaal , and hath made <unk> , his servant , ruler over the men of <unk> , the father of Sichem ?
Why then shall we serve him ?
Would to God that some man would put this people under my hand , that I might remove Abimelech out of the way .
And it was said to Abimelech : Gather together the multitude of an army , and come .
For <unk> , the ruler of the city , hearing the words of Gaal , the son of Obed , was very angry ,
And sent messengers privately to Abimelech , saying : Behold , Gaal , the son of Obed , is come into Sichem with his brethren , and <unk> to set the city against thee .
Arise , therefore , in the night , with the people that is with thee , and lie hid in the field :
And <unk> in the morning , at sun rising , set upon the city , and when he shall come out against thee , with his people , do to him what thou shalt be able .
Abimelech , therefore , arose with all his army , by night , and laid ambushes near Sichem in four places .
And Gaal , the son of Obed , went out , and stood in the entrance of the gate of the city .
And Abimelech rose up , and all his army with him , from the places of the ambushes .
And when Gaal saw the people , he said to <unk> : Behold , a multitude cometh down from the mountains .
And he answered him : Thou seest the <unk> of the mountains as if they were the heads of men , and this is thy <unk> .
Again Gaal said : Behold , there cometh people down from the midst of the land , and one <unk> cometh by the way that looketh towards the oak .
And <unk> said to him : Where is now thy mouth , wherewith thou saidst : Who is Abimelech , that we should serve him ?
Is not this the people which thou didst despise ?
Go out , and fight against him .
So Gaal went out , in the sight of the people of Sichem , and fought against Abimelech , 9 : 40 . Who <unk> and put him to flight , and drove him to the city : and many were slain of his people , even to the gate of the city :
And Abimelech sat down in <unk> : but <unk> drove Gaal , and his companions , out of the city , and would not suffer them to abide in it .
So the day following the people went out into the field .
And it was told to Abimelech ,
And he took his army , and divided it into three companies , and laid ambushes in the fields .
And seeing that the people came out of the city , he arose , and set upon them ,
With his own company , <unk> and besieging the city : whilst the two other companies <unk> the enemies that were scattered about the field .
And Abimelech <unk> the city all that day : and took it , and killed the inhabitants thereof , and <unk> it , so that he sowed salt in it .
<unk> salt .... To make the ground barren , and fit for nothing .
And when they who dwelt in the tower of Sichem , had heard this , they went into the temple of their god <unk> , where they had made a covenant with him , and from thence the place had taken its name , and it was exceeding strong .
Abimelech also hearing that the men of the tower of Sichem were gathered together ,
<unk> up into mount <unk> , he and all his people with him : and taking an axe , he cut down the <unk> of a tree , and laying it on his shoulder , and carrying it , he said to his companions : What you see me do , do ye out of hand .
So they cut down boughs from the trees , every man as fast as he could , and followed their leader .
And <unk> the <unk> , they set it on fire : and so it came to pass , that with the smoke and with the fire a thousand persons were killed , men and women together , of the inhabitants of the town of Sichem .
Then Abimelech , departing from thence , came to the town of <unk> , which he surrounded and besieged with his army .
And there was in the midst of the city a high tower , to which both the men and the women were fled together , and all the princes of the city , and having shut and strongly <unk> the gate , they stood upon the <unk> of the tower to defend themselves .
And Abimelech , coming near the tower , fought <unk> : and , approaching to the gate , <unk> to set fire to it :
And behold , a certain woman casting a piece of a <unk> from above , <unk> it against the head of Abimelech , and broke his <unk> .
And he called <unk> to his armourbearer , and said to him : Draw thy sword , and kill me : lest it should be said that I was slain by a woman .
He did as he was commanded , and slew him .
And when he was dead all the men of Israel that were with him , returned to their <unk> .
And God <unk> the evil that Abimelech had done against his father , killing his seventy brethren .
The <unk> also were rewarded for what they had done , and the curse of Joatham , the son of Jerobaal , came upon them .
Judges Chapter 10 <unk> ruleth Israel twenty-three years ; and Jair twenty-two .
The people fall again into idolatry , and are afflicted again by the Philistines and Ammonites .
They cry to God for help , who upon their repentance hath compassion on them .
After Abimelech , there arose a ruler in Israel , <unk> , son of <unk> , the uncle of Abimelech , a man of Issachar , who dwelt in <unk> of mount Ephraim : <unk> of Abimelech .... <unk> <unk> . , half brother to Gedeon , as being born of the same mother , but by a different father , and of a different tribe .
And he judged Israel three and twenty years , and he died , and was buried in <unk> .
To him succeeded Jair , the Galaadite , who judged Israel for two and twenty years ,
Having thirty sons , that <unk> on thirty ass <unk> , and were princes of thirty cities , which from his name were called <unk> Jair , that is , the towns of Jair , until this present day , in the land of Galaad .
<unk> Jair ....
This name was now confirmed to these towns , which they had formerly received from another Jair .
Num .
<unk> .
And Jair died , and was buried in the place which is called <unk> .
But the children of Israel , <unk> new sins to their old ones , did evil in the sight of the Lord , and served idols , Baalim and Astaroth , and the gods of Syria , and of Sidon , and of Moab , and of the children of Ammon , and of the Philistines : and they left the Lord , and did not serve him .
And the Lord being angry with them , delivered them into the hands of the Philistines , and of the children of Ammon .
And they were afflicted , and grievously oppressed for eighteen years , all they that dwelt beyond the Jordan in the land of the Amorrhite , who is in Galaad :
<unk> that the children of Ammon , passing over the Jordan , wasted Juda , and Benjamin , and Ephraim : and Israel was <unk> exceedingly .
And they cried to the Lord , and said , We have sinned against thee , because we have forsaken the Lord our God , and have served Baalim .
And the Lord said to them : Did not the Egyptians , and the Amorrhites , and the children of Ammon , and the Philistines ,
The Sidonians also , and Amalec , and Chanaan , oppress you , and you cried to me , and I delivered you out of their hand ?
And yet you have forsaken me , and have worshipped strange gods : therefore I will deliver you no more :
Go , and call upon the gods which you have chosen : let them deliver you in the time of distress .
And the children of Israel said to the Lord : We have sinned , do thou unto us whatsoever pleaseth thee : only deliver us this time .
And saying these things , they cast away out of their coasts all the idols of strange gods , and served the Lord their God : and he was touched with their miseries .
And the children of Ammon shouting together , pitched their tents in Galaad : against whom the children of Israel assembled themselves together , and camped in Maspha .
And the princes of Galaad said one to another : Whosoever of us shall first begin to fight against the children of Ammon , he shall be the leader of the people of Galaad .
Judges Chapter 11 Jephte is made ruler of the people of Galaad : he first <unk> their cause against the Ammonites ; then making a vow <unk> a <unk> victory ; he <unk> his vow .
There was at that time Jephte , the Galaadite , a most valiant man , and a <unk> , the son of a woman that was a harlot , and his father was Galaad .
Now Galaad had a wife of whom he had sons : who , after they were grown up , thrust out Jephte , saying : Thou canst not inherit in the house of our father , because thou art born of another mother .
Then he fled and <unk> them , and dwelt in the land of <unk> : and there were gathered to him needy men and robbers , and they followed him as their prince .
In those days the children of Ammon made war against Israel .
And as they pressed hard upon them , the ancients of Galaad went to fetch Jephte out of the land of <unk> to help them :
And they said to him : Come thou , and be our prince , and fight against the children of Ammon .
And he answered them : Are not you the men that hated me , and cast me out of my father ’ s house , and now you are come to me , constrained by necessity ?
And the princes of Galaad said to Jephte : For this cause we are now come to thee , that thou mayst go with us , and fight against the children of Ammon , and be head over all the inhabitants of Galaad .
Jephte also said to them : If you be come to me sincerely , that I should fight for you against the children of Ammon , and the Lord shall deliver them into my hand , shall I be your prince ?
They answered him : The Lord , who heareth these things , he himself is mediator and witness that we will do as we have promised .
Jephte therefore went with the princes of Galaad , and all the people made him their prince .
And Jephte spoke all his words before the Lord in Maspha .
And he sent messengers to the king of the children of Ammon , to say in his name : What hast thou to do with me , that thou art come against me , to waste my land ?
And he answered them : Because Israel took away my land , when he came up out of Egypt , from the confines of the Arnon unto the <unk> and the Jordan : now , therefore , restore the same peaceably to me .
And Jephte again sent word by them , and commanded them to say to the king of Ammon :
Thus saith Jephte : Israel did not take away the land of Moab , nor the land of the children of Ammon :
But when they came up out of Egypt , he walked through the desert to the Red Sea , and came into Cades .
And he sent messengers to the king of Edom , saying : Suffer me to pass through thy land .
But he would not <unk> to his request .
He sent also to the king of Moab , who , likewise , refused to give him passage .
He abode , therefore , in Cades ,
And went round the land of Edom at the side , and the land of Moab : and came over against the east coast of the land of Moab , and camped on the other side of the Arnon : and he would not enter the bounds of Moab .
So Israel sent messengers to Sehon , king of the Amorrhites , who dwelt in Hesebon , and they said to him : Suffer me to pass through thy land to the river .
But he , also <unk> the words of Israel , suffered him not to pass through his borders : but gathering an infinite multitude , went out against him to <unk> , and made strong opposition .
And the Lord delivered him , with all his army , into the hands of Israel , and he slew him , and possessed all the land of the Amorrhite , the inhabitant of that country ,
And all the coasts thereof from the Arnon to the <unk> , and from the wilderness to the Jordan .
So the Lord , the God of Israel , destroyed the Amorrhite , his people of Israel fighting against him , and wilt thou now possess his land ?
Are not those things which thy god Chamos possesseth , due to thee by right ?
But what the Lord our God hath obtained by <unk> , shall be our possession : Chamos ....
The idol of the Moabites and Ammonites .
He <unk> from their opinion , who thought they had a just title to the countries which they imagined they had conquered by the help of their gods : how much more then had Israel in <unk> title to the countries which God , by <unk> miracles , had conquered for them .
Unless , perhaps , thou art better than Balac , the son of <unk> , king of Moab : or canst shew that he <unk> against Israel , and fought against him ,
Whereas he hath dwelt in Hesebon , and the villages thereof , and in Aroer , and its villages , and in all the cities near the Jordan , for three hundred years .
Why have you for so long a time attempted nothing about this <unk> ?
Therefore I do not trespass against thee , but thou <unk> me by <unk> an unjust war against me .
The Lord be judge , and <unk> this day , between Israel and the children of Ammon .
And the king of the children of Ammon would not hearken to the words of Jephte , which he sent him by the messengers .
Therefore the spirit of the Lord came upon Jephte , and going round Galaad , and Manasses , and Maspha of Galaad , and passing over from thence to the children of Ammon ,
He made a vow to the Lord , saying : If thou wilt deliver the children of Ammon into my hands ,
Whosoever shall first come forth out of the doors of my house , and shall meet me , when I return in peace from the children of Ammon , the same will I offer a holocaust to the Lord .
Whosoever , etc ....
Some are of opinion , that the meaning of this vow of Jephte , was to consecrate to God whatsoever should first meet him , according to the condition of the thing ; so as to offer it up as a holocaust , if it were such a thing as might be offered by the law ; or to <unk> it otherwise to God , if it were not such as the law allowed to be offered in sacrifice .
And therefore they think the daughter of Jephte was not slain by her father , but only consecrated to perpetual virginity .
But the common opinion followed by the <unk> of the holy fathers and <unk> is , that she was offered as a holocaust , in consequence of her father ’ s vow : and that Jephte did not sin , at least not <unk> , neither in making , nor in keeping , his vow : since he is no ways <unk> for it in scripture ; and was even inspired by God himself to make the vow ( as appears from ver .
29 , 30 ) in consequence of which he obtained the victory ; and therefore he <unk> <unk> that God , who is the master of life and death , was pleased on this occasion to <unk> with his own law ; and that it was the divine will he should fulfil his vow .
And Jephte passed over to the children of Ammon to fight against them : and the Lord delivered them into his hands .
And he smote them from Aroer till you come to <unk> , twenty cities , and as far as Abel , which is set with vineyards , with a very great slaughter : and the children of Ammon were humbled by the children of Israel .
And when Jephte returned into Maspha , to his house , his only daughter met him with timbrels and with <unk> : for he had no other children .
And when he saw her , he rent his garments , and said : Alas !
my daughter , thou hast deceived me , and thou thyself art deceived : for I have opened my mouth to the Lord , and I can do no other thing .
And she answered him : My father , if thou hast opened thy mouth to the Lord , do unto me whatsoever thou hast promised , since the victory hath been granted to thee , and revenge of thy enemies .
And she said to her father : <unk> me only this , which I desire : Let me go , that I may go about the mountains for two months , and may <unk> my virginity with my companions .
<unk> my virginity ....
The bearing of children was much coveted under the Old Testament , when women might hope that from some child of theirs , the Saviour of the world might one day spring .
But under the New Testament virginity is preferred .
1 Cor .
<unk> .
And he answered her : Go .
And he sent her away for two months .
And when she was gone with her <unk> and companions , she mourned her virginity in the mountains .
And the two months being expired , she returned to her father , and he did to her as he had vowed , and she knew no man .
From thence came a <unk> in Israel , and a custom has been kept :
That , from year to year , the daughters of Israel assemble together , and lament the daughter of Jephte the Galaadite , for four days .
Judges Chapter 12 The <unk> <unk> with Jephte : forty-two thousand of them are slain : <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , are judges .
But behold there arose a sedition in Ephraim .
And passing towards the north , they said to Jephte : When thou <unk> to fight against the children of Ammon , why wouldst thou not call us , that we might go with thee ?
Therefore we will burn thy house .
And he answered them : I and my people were at great strife with the children of Ammon : and I called you to assist me , and you would not do it .
And when I saw this , I put my life in my own hands , and passed over against the children of Ammon and the Lord delivered them into my hands .
What have I deserved , that you should rise up to fight against me ?
Then calling to him all the men of Galaad , he fought against Ephraim : and the men of Galaad defeated Ephraim , because he had said : Galaad is a fugitive of Ephraim , and dwelleth in the midst of Ephraim and Manasses .
And the <unk> <unk> the <unk> of the Jordan , by which Ephraim was to return .
And when any one of the number of Ephraim came thither in the flight , and said : I beseech you let me pass : the <unk> said to him : Art thou not an <unk> ?
If he said : I am not :
They asked him : Say then , <unk> , which is interpreted , An ear of corn .
But he answered , <unk> , not being able to express an ear of corn by the same letter .
Then presently they took him and killed him in the very passage of the Jordan .
And there fell at that time of Ephraim , two and forty thousand .
And Jephte , the Galaadite , judged Israel six years : and he died , and was buried in his city of Galaad .
After him <unk> of Bethlehem judged Israel :
He had thirty sons , and as many daughters , whom he sent abroad , and gave to husbands , and took wives for his sons , of the same number , bringing them into his house .
And he judged Israel seven years :
And he died , and was buried in Bethlehem .
To him succeeded <unk> , a <unk> : and he judged Israel ten years :
And he died , and was buried in Zabulon .
After him , <unk> , the son of <unk> , a <unk> , judged Israel :
And he had forty sons , and of them thirty grandsons , <unk> upon seventy ass <unk> , and he judged Israel eight years :
And he died , and was buried in <unk> , in the land of Ephraim , in the mount of <unk> .
Judges Chapter 13 The people fall again into idolatry and are afflicted by the Philistines .
An angel foretelleth the birth of Samson .
And the children of Israel did evil again in the sight of the Lord : and he delivered them into the hands of the Philistines forty years .
Now there was a certain man of Saraa , and of the race of Dan , whose name was Manue , and his wife was barren .
And an angel of the Lord appeared to her , and said : Thou art barren and without children : but thou shalt conceive and bear a son .
Now therefore beware , and drink no wine nor strong drink , and eat not any unclean thing .
Because thou shalt conceive , and bear a son , and no <unk> shall touch his head : for he shall be a Nazarite of God , from his infancy , and from his mother ’ s womb , and he shall begin to deliver Israel from the hands of the Philistines .
And when she was come to her husband , she said to him : A man of God came to me , having the countenance of an angel , very <unk> .
And when I asked him who he was , and whence he came , and by what name he was called , he would not tell me :
But he answered thus : Behold thou shalt conceive and bear a son : beware thou drink no wine , nor strong drink , nor eat any unclean thing : for the child shall be a Nazarite of God from his infancy , from his mother ’ s womb until the day of his death .
Then Manue prayed to the Lord , and said : I beseech thee , O Lord , that the man of God , whom thou didst send , may come again , and teach us what we ought to do concerning the child , that shall be born .
And the Lord heard the prayer of Manue , and the angel of the Lord appeared again to his wife , as she was sitting in the field .
But Manue her husband was not with her .
And when she saw the angel ,
She made haste , and ran to her husband : and told him , saying : Behold the man hath appeared to me , whom I saw before .
He rose up , and followed his wife : and coming to the man , said to him : Art thou he that spoke to the woman ?
And he answered : I am .
And Manue said to him : When thy word shall come to pass , what wilt thou that the child should do ?
or from what shall he keep himself ?
And the angel of the Lord said to Manue : From all the things I have spoken of to thy wife , let her refrain herself : Let her refrain , etc .... By the Latin text it is not clear whether this <unk> was <unk> to the mother , or to the child ; but the Hebrew ( in which the <unk> relating <unk> are of the <unk> <unk> ) <unk> it to the mother .
But then the child also was to refrain from the like things , because he was to be from his infancy a Nazarite of God , ver .
5 , that is , one set aside , in a particular manner , and consecrated to God : now the <unk> by the law were to abstain from all these things .
And let her eat nothing that cometh of the vine , neither let her drink wine or strong drink , nor eat any unclean thing : and whatsoever I have commanded her , let her fulfil and observe .
And Manue said to the angel of the Lord : I beseech thee to consent to my request , and let us dress a kid for thee .
And the angel answered him : If thou press me I will not eat of thy bread : but if thou wilt offer a holocaust , offer it to the Lord .
And Manue knew not it was the angel of the Lord .
And he said to him : What is thy name , that , if thy word shall come to pass , we may honour thee ?
And he answered him : Why <unk> thou my name , which is wonderful ?
Then Manue took a kid of the flocks , and the libations , and put them upon a rock , offering to the Lord , who doth wonderful things : and he and his wife looked on .
And when the flame from the altar went up towards heaven , the angel of the Lord ascended also in the flame .
And when Manue and his wife saw this , they fell flat on the ground ;
And the angel of the Lord appeared to them no more .
And forthwith Manue understood that it was an angel of the Lord ,
And he said to his wife : We shall certainly die , because we have seen God .
<unk> God .... Not in his own person , but in the person of his messenger .
The Israelites , in those days , imagined they should die if they saw an angel , taking occasion perhaps from those words spoken by the Lord to Moses , Ex .
<unk> , No man shall see me and live .
But the event <unk> that it was but a <unk> <unk> .
And his wife answered him : If the Lord had a mind to kill us , he would not have received a holocaust and libations at our hands ; neither would he have shewed us all these things , nor have told us the things that are to come .
And she bore a son , and called his name Samson .
And the child grew , and the Lord blessed him .
And the Spirit of the Lord began to be with him in the camp of Dan , between Saraa and <unk> .
Judges Chapter 14 Samson desireth a wife of the Philistines .
He killeth a lion : in whose mouth he afterwards findeth honey .
His marriage feast , and <unk> , which is discovered by his wife .
He killeth , and <unk> thirty Philistines .
His wife taketh another man .
Then Samson went down to <unk> , and seeing there a woman of the daughters of the Philistines ,
He came up , and told his father and his mother , saying : I saw a woman in <unk> of the daughters of the Philistines : I beseech you , take her for me to wife .
And his father and mother said to him : Is there no woman among the daughters of thy brethren , or among all my people , that thou wilt take a wife of the Philistines , who are uncircumcised ?
And Samson said to his father : Take this woman for me ; for she hath pleased my eyes .
Is there no woman among the daughters of thy brethren ....
This shews his parents were at first against his marriage with a <unk> , it being <unk> , Deut .
<unk> ; but afterwards they consented , knowing it to be by the dispensation of God ; which otherwise would have been sinful in <unk> contrary to the law .
Now his parents knew not that the thing was done by the Lord , and that he sought an occasion against the Philistines : for at that time the Philistines had dominion over Israel .
Then Samson went down with his father and mother to <unk> .
And when they were come to the vineyards of the town , behold a young lion met him , raging and roaring .
And the Spirit of the Lord came upon Samson , and he <unk> the lion as he would have torn a kid in pieces , having nothing at all in his hand : and he would not tell this to his father and mother .
And he went down , and spoke to the woman that had pleased his eyes .
And after some days , returning to take her , he went aside to see the carcass of the lion , and behold there was a <unk> of <unk> in the mouth of the lion , and a <unk> .
And when he had taken it in his hands , he went on eating : and coming to his father and mother , he gave them of it , and they ate : but he would not tell them that he had taken the honey from the body of the lion .
So his father went down to the woman , and made a feast for his son Samson : for so the young men used to do .
And when the citizens of that place saw him , they brought him thirty companions to be with him .
And Samson said to them : I will <unk> to you a <unk> , which if you declare unto me within the seven days of the feast , I will give you thirty <unk> , and as many coats :
But if you shall not be able to declare it , you shall give me thirty <unk> and the same number of coats .
They answered him : Put forth the <unk> , that we may hear it .
And he said to them : Out of the <unk> came forth meat , and out of the strong came forth sweetness .
And they could not for three days expound the <unk> .
And when the seventh day came , they said to the wife of Samson : <unk> thy husband , and persuade him to tell thee what the <unk> meaneth .
But if thou wilt not do it , we will burn thee , and thy father ’ s house .
Have you called us to the <unk> on purpose to strip us ?
So she wept before Samson and <unk> , saying : Thou <unk> me , and dost not love me : therefore thou wilt not expound to me the <unk> , which thou hast proposed to the sons of my people .
But he answered : I would not tell it to my father and mother : and how can I tell it to thee ?
So she wept before him the seven days of the feast : and , at length , on the seventh day , as she was troublesome to him , he <unk> it .
And she immediately told her countrymen .
And they , on the seventh day before the sun went down , said to him : What is <unk> than honey ?
and what is stronger than a lion ?
And he said to them : If you had not <unk> with my heifer , you had not found out my <unk> .
And the Spirit of the Lord came upon him , and he went down to Ascalon , and slew there thirty men whose garments he took away , and gave to them that had declared the <unk> .
And being exceeding angry , he went up to his father ’ s house :
But his wife took one of his friends and <unk> companions for her husband .
Judges Chapter 15 Samson is denied his wife .
He <unk> the corn of the Philistines , and <unk> many of them .
And a while after , when the days of the wheat harvest were at hand , Samson came , meaning to visit his wife , and he brought her a kid of the flock .
And when he would have gone into her chamber , as usual , her father would not suffer him , saying :
I thought thou hadst hated her , and therefore I gave her to thy friend : but she hath a sister , who is younger and <unk> than she , take her to wife instead of her .
And Samson answered him : From this day I shall be blameless in what I do against the Philistines : for I will do you evils .
And he went and caught three hundred foxes , and <unk> them tail to tail , and fastened <unk> between the <unk> : <unk> ....
Being judge of the people he might have many to assist him to catch with nets or otherwise a number of these animals ; of which there were great numbers in that country .
And setting them on fire he let the foxes go , that they might run about hither and thither .
And they presently went into the standing corn of the Philistines .
Which being set on fire , both the corn that was already carried together , and that which was yet standing , was all burnt , insomuch that the flame consumed also the vineyards and the <unk> .
Then the Philistines said : Who hath done this thing ?
And it was answered : Samson , the son in law of the <unk> , because he took away his wife , and gave her to another , hath done these things .
And the Philistines went up and burnt both the woman and her father .
But Samson said to them : Although you have done this , yet will I be revenged of you , and then I will be quiet .
And he made a great slaughter of them , so that in astonishment they laid the calf of the <unk> upon the thigh .
And going down he dwelt in a <unk> of the rock <unk> .
Then the Philistines going up into the land of Juda , camped in the place which afterwards was called <unk> , that is , the <unk> , where their army was spread abroad .
And the men of the tribe of Juda said to them : Why are you come up against us ?
They answered : We are come to bind Samson , and to pay him for what he hath done against us .
Wherefore three thousand men of Juda went down to the cave of the rock <unk> , and said to Samson : Knowest thou not that the Philistines rule over us ?
Why wouldst thou do thus ?
And he said to them : As they did to me , so have I done to them .
And they said to him : We are come to bind thee , and to deliver thee into the hands of the Philistines .
And Samson said to them : <unk> to me , and promise me that you will not kill me .
They said : We will not kill thee : but we will deliver thee up bound .
And they bound him with two new cords , and brought him from the rock <unk> .
Now when he was come to the place of the <unk> , and the Philistines shouting went to meet him , the Spirit of the Lord came strongly upon him : and as flax is wont to be consumed at the approach of fire , so the bands with which he was bound were broken and loosed .
And finding a <unk> , even the <unk> of an ass , which lay there , <unk> it up , he slew therewith a thousand men .
And he said : With the <unk> of an ass , with the <unk> of the colt of asses , I have destroyed them , and have slain a thousand men .
And when he had ended these words , singing , he threw the <unk> out of his hand , and called the name of that place <unk> , which is interpreted the lifting up of the <unk> .
And being very thirsty , he cried to the Lord , and said : Thou hast given this very great deliverance and victory into the hand of thy servant : and behold I die for thirst , and shall fall into the hands of the uncircumcised .
Then the Lord opened a great tooth in the <unk> of the ass and waters <unk> out of it .
And when he had drunk them , he refreshed his spirit , and recovered his strength .
Therefore the name of that place was called The <unk> of him that invoked from the <unk> , until this present day .
And he judged Israel , in the days of the Philistines , twenty years .
Judges Chapter 16 Samson is <unk> by <unk> : and <unk> into the hands of the Philistines .
His death .
He went also into Gaza , and saw there a woman , a harlot , and went in unto her .
And when the Philistines had heard this , and it was <unk> about among them , that Samson was come into the city , they surrounded him , setting guards at the gate of the city , and watching there all the night in silence , that in the morning they might kill him as he went out .
But Samson slept till midnight , and then rising , he took both the doors of the gate , with the posts thereof and the <unk> , and laying them on his shoulders , carried them up to the top of the hill , which looketh towards Hebron .
After this he loved a woman , who dwelt in the valley of <unk> , and she was called <unk> .
<unk> ....
Some are of opinion she was married to Samson ; others that she was his harlot .
If the latter opinion be true , we cannot wonder that , in punishment of his lust , the Lord delivered him up , by her means , into the hands of his enemies .
However if he was guilty , it is not to be <unk> but that under his afflictions he <unk> repented and returned to God , and so obtained forgiveness of his sins .
And the princes of the Philistines came to her , and said : <unk> him , and learn of him wherein his great strength lieth , and how we may be able to overcome him , to bind and afflict him : which if thou shalt do , we will give thee every one of us eleven hundred pieces of silver .
And <unk> said to Samson : Tell me , I beseech thee , wherein thy greatest strength lieth , and what it is , wherewith if thou wert bound , thou <unk> not break loose .
And Samson answered her : If I shall be bound with seven cords , made of <unk> not yet dry , but still <unk> , I shall be weak like other men .
And the princes of the Philistines brought unto her seven cords , such as he spoke of , with which she bound him ;
Men lying privately in wait with her , and in the chamber , expecting the event of the thing , and she cried out to him : The Philistines are upon thee , Samson .
And he broke the bands , as a man would break a <unk> of <unk> <unk> with <unk> , when it <unk> the fire : so it was not known wherein his strength lay .
And <unk> said to him : Behold thou hast mocked me , and hast told me a false thing : but now at least tell me wherewith thou mayest be bound .
And he answered her : If I shall be bound with new <unk> , that were never in work , I shall be weak and like other men .
<unk> bound him again with these , and cried out : The Philistines are upon thee , Samson , there being an ambush prepared for him in the chamber .
But he broke the bands like <unk> of <unk> .
And <unk> said to him again : How long dost thou deceive me , and tell me lies ?
Shew me wherewith thou mayest be bound .
And Samson answered her : If thou <unk> the seven locks of my head with a <unk> , and <unk> them round about a nail , <unk> it in the ground , I shall be weak .
And when <unk> had done this , she said to him : The Philistines are upon thee , Samson .
And <unk> out of his sleep , he drew out the nail with the hairs and the <unk> .
And <unk> said to him : How dost thou say thou lovest me , when thy mind is not with me ?
Thou hast told me lies these three times , and wouldst not tell me wherein thy greatest strength lieth .
And when she pressed him much , and continually hung upon him for many days , giving him no time to rest , his soul fainted away , and was wearied even unto death .
Then opening the truth of the thing , he said to her : The <unk> hath never come upon my head , for I am a Nazarite , that is to say , consecrated to God from my mother ’ s womb : If my head be <unk> , my strength shall depart from me , and I shall become weak , and shall be like other men .
Then seeing that he had discovered to her all his mind , she sent to the princes of the Philistines , saying : Come up this once more , for now he hath opened his heart to me .
And they went up , taking with them the money which they had promised .
But she made him sleep upon her knees , and lay his head in her bosom .
And she called a <unk> and <unk> his seven locks , and began to drive him away , and thrust him from her : for immediately his strength departed from him .
And she said : The Philistines are upon thee , Samson .
And <unk> from sleep , he said in his mind : I will go out as I did before , and shake myself , not knowing that the Lord was departed from him .
Then the Philistines seized upon him , and forthwith <unk> out his eyes , and led him bound in chains to Gaza , and <unk> him up in prison made him <unk> .
And now his hair began to grow again ,
And the princes of the Philistines assembled together , to offer great sacrifices to Dagon their god , and to make merry , saying : Our god hath delivered our enemy Samson into our hands .
And the people also seeing this , praised their god , and said the same : Our god hath delivered our adversary into our hands , him that destroyed our country , and killed very many .
And rejoicing in their feasts , when they had now taken their good cheer , they commanded that Samson should be called , and should play before them .
And being brought out of prison , he played before them ; and they made him stand between two pillars .
And he said to the <unk> that <unk> his steps : Suffer me to touch the pillars which support the whole house , and let me lean upon them , and rest a little .
Now the house was full of men and women , and all the princes of the Philistines were there .
Moreover about three thousand persons of both <unk> , from the roof and the higher part of the house , were beholding Samson ’ s play .
But he called upon the Lord , saying : O Lord God remember me , and restore to me now my former strength , O my God , that I may revenge myself on my enemies , and for the loss of my two eyes I may take one revenge .
<unk> myself ....
This desire of revenge was out of zeal for justice against the enemies of God and his people ; and not out of private <unk> and malice of heart .
And laying hold on both the pillars on which the house rested , and holding the one with his right hand , and the other with his left ,
He said : Let me die with the Philistines .
And when he had strongly shook the pillars , the house fell upon all the princes , and the rest of the multitude , that was there : and he killed many more at his death , than he had killed before in his life .
Let me die ....
Literally , let my soul die .
Samson did not sin on this occasion , though he was <unk> the cause of his own death .
Because he was moved to what he did , by a particular <unk> of God , who also <unk> with him by a miracle , in <unk> his strength upon the spot , in consequence of his prayer .
Samson , by dying in this manner , was a figure of Christ , who by his death overcame all his enemies .
And his brethren and all his kindred , going down took his body , and buried it between Saraa and <unk> , in the <unk> of his father Manue : and he judged Israel twenty years .
Judges Chapter 17 The history of the idol of Michas , and the young Levite .
There was at that time a man of mount Ephraim , whose name was Michas .
17 : 2 . Who said to his mother : The eleven hundred pieces of silver , which thou hadst put aside for thyself , and concerning which thou didst swear in my hearing , behold I have , and they are with me .
And she said to him .
Blessed be my son by the Lord .
So he restored them to his mother , who said to him : I have consecrated and vowed this silver to the Lord , that my son may receive it at my hand , and make a graven and a molten god ; so now I deliver it to thee .
And he restored them to his mother : and she took two hundred pieces of silver and gave them to the <unk> , to make of them a graven and a molten god , which was in the house of Michas .
And he separated also therein a little temple for the god , and made an ephod , and <unk> , that is to say , a priestly garment , and idols : and he filled the hand of one of his sons , and he became his priest .
<unk> the hand .... That is , appointed and consecrated him to the priestly office .
In those days there was no king in Israel , but every one did that which seemed right to himself .
There was also another young man of Bethlehem Juda , of the kindred thereof : and he was a Levite , and dwelt there .
Now he went out from the city of Bethlehem , and desired to sojourn wheresoever he should find it convenient for him .
And when he was come to mount Ephraim , as he was on his journey , and had turned aside a little into the house of Michas ,
He was asked by him whence he came .
And he answered : I am a Levite of Bethlehem Juda , and I am going to dwell where I can , and where I shall find a place to my advantage .
And Michas said : Stay with me , and be unto me a father and a priest , and I will give thee every year ten pieces of silver , and a double <unk> of apparel , and thy victuals .
He was content , and abode with the man , and was unto him as one of his sons .
And Michas filled his hand , and had the young man with him for his priest , saying :
Now I know God will do me good , since I have a priest of the race of the Levites .
Judges Chapter 18 The <unk> of the men of Dan against <unk> : in their way they <unk> Michas of his priest and his gods .
In those days there was no king in Israel , and the tribe of Dan sought them an inheritance to dwell in : for unto that day they had not received their lot among the other tribes .
Not received , etc ....
They had their portions <unk> them , Jos .
<unk> .
But , through their own <unk> , possessed as yet but a small part of it .
See Judges <unk> .
So the children of Dan sent five most valiant men , of their stock and family , from Saraa and <unk> , to spy out the land , and to view it diligently : and they said to them : Go , and view the land .
They went on their way , and when they came to mount Ephraim , they went into the house of Michas , and rested there :
And knowing the voice of the young man the Levite , and lodging with him , they said to him : Who brought thee hither ?
what dost thou here ?
why wouldst thou come hither ?
He answered them : Michas hath done such and such things for me , and hath hired me to be his priest .
Then they desired him to consult the Lord , that they might know whether their journey should be prosperous , and the thing should have effect .
He answered them : Go in peace : the Lord looketh on your way , and the journey that you go .
So the five men going on came to <unk> : and they saw how the people dwelt therein without any fear , according to the custom of the Sidonians , secure and easy , having no man at all to <unk> them , being very rich , and living separated , at a distance from Sidon and from all men .
And they returned to their brethren in Saraa and <unk> , who asked them what they had done : to whom they answered :
Arise , and let us go up to them : for we have seen the land which is exceeding rich and fruitful : neglect not , lose no time : let us go and possess it , there will be no <unk> .
We shall come to a people that is secure , into a <unk> country , and the Lord will deliver the place to us , in which there is no want of any thing that groweth on the earth .
There went therefore of the kindred of Dan , to wit , from Saraa and <unk> , six hundred men , furnished with arms for war .
And going up they lodged in Cariathiarim of Juda : which place from that time is called the camp of Dan , and is behind Cariathiarim .
From thence they passed into mount Ephraim .
And when they were come to the house of Michas ,
The five men , that before had been sent to view the land of <unk> , said to the rest of their brethren : You know that in these houses there is an ephod and <unk> , and a graven and a molten god : see what you are pleased to do .
And when they had turned a little aside , they went into the house of the young man the Levite , who was in the house of Michas : and they saluted him with words of peace .
And the six hundred men stood before the door , appointed with their arms .
But they that were gone into the house of the young man , went about to take away the graven god , and the ephod , and the <unk> , and the molten god , and the priest stood before the door , the six hundred valiant men waiting not far off .
So they that were gone in took away the graven thing , the ephod , and the idols , and the molten god , And the priest said to them : What are you doing ?
And they said to him : <unk> thy peace , and put thy finger on thy mouth , and come with us , that we may have thee for a father , and a priest .
Whether is better for thee , to be a priest in the house of one man , or in a tribe and family in Israel ?
When he heard this , he agreed to their words , and took the ephod , and the idols , and the graven god , and departed with them .
And when they were going forward , and had put before them the children and the cattle , and all that was <unk> ,
And were now at a distance from the house of Michas , the men that dwelt in the houses of Michas gathering together followed them ,
And began to shout out after them .
They looked back , and said to Michas : What <unk> thee ?
Why dost thou cry ?
And he answered : You have taken away my gods which I have made me , and the priest , and all that I have , and do you say : What <unk> thee ?
And the children of Dan said to him : See thou say no more to us , lest men <unk> come upon thee , and thou perish with all thy house .
And so they went on the journey they had begun .
But Michas seeing that they were stronger than he , returned to his house .
And the six hundred men took the priest , and the things we spoke of before , and came to <unk> , to a people that was quiet and secure , and smote them with the edge of the sword : and the city they burnt with fire ,
There being no man at all who brought them any succour , because they dwelt far from Sidon , and had no society or business with any man .
And the city was in the land of Rohob : and they rebuilt it , and dwelt therein ,
<unk> the name of the city Dan , after the name of their father , who was the son of Israel , which before was called <unk> .
And they set up to themselves the graven idol , and Jonathan the son of <unk> , the son of Moses , he and his sons were priests in the tribe of Dan , until the day of their captivity .
And the idol of Michas remained with them all the time that the house of God was in Silo .
In those days there was no king in Israel .
Judges Chapter 19 A Levite bringing home his wife , is lodged by an old man at Gabaa in the tribe of Benjamin .
His wife is there abused by wicked men , and in the morning found dead .
Her husband <unk> her body in pieces , and sendeth to every tribe of Israel , <unk> them to revenge the wicked <unk> .
There was a certain Levite , who dwelt on the side of mount Ephraim , who took a wife of Bethlehem Juda :
And she left him , and returned to her father ’ s house in Bethlehem , and abode with him four months .
And her husband followed her , willing to be reconciled with her , and to speak <unk> to her , and to bring her back with him , having with him a servant and two asses : and she received him , and brought him into her father ’ s house .
And when his father in law had heard this , and had seen him , he met him with joy ,
And <unk> the man .
And the son in law tarried in the house of his father in law three days , eating with him and drinking <unk> .
But on the fourth day , <unk> early in the morning , he desired to depart .
But his father in law kept him , and said to him : <unk> first a little bread , and strengthen thy <unk> , and so thou shalt depart .
And they sat down together , and ate and drank .
And the father of the young woman said to his son in law : I beseech thee to stay here to day , and let us make merry together .
But he rising up , began to be for departing .
And nevertheless his father in law earnestly pressed him , and made him stay with him .
But when morning was come , the Levite prepared to go on his journey .
And his father in law said to him again : I beseech thee to take a little meat , and <unk> thyself , till the day be farther advanced , afterwards thou mayest depart .
And they ate together .
And the young man arose to set forward with his wife and servant .
And his father in law spoke to him again : Consider that the day is <unk> , and <unk> toward evening : tarry with me to day also , and spend the day in mirth , and to morrow thou shalt depart , that thou mayest go into thy house .
His son in law would not consent to his words : but forthwith went forward , and came over against <unk> , which by another name is called Jerusalem , <unk> with him two asses laden , and his concubine .
<unk> .
She was his lawful wife , but even lawful wives are <unk> in scripture called concubines .
See above , chap .

Jemini .... That is , Benjamin .
And now they were come near <unk> , and the day was far spent : and the servant said to his master : Come , I beseech thee , let us turn into the city of the Jebusites , and lodge there .
His master answered him : I will not go into the town of another nation , who are not of the children of Israel , but I will pass over to Gabaa :
And when I shall come thither , we will lodge there , or at least in the city of Rama .
So they passed by <unk> , and went on their journey , and the sun went down upon them when they were by Gabaa , which is in the tribe of Benjamin :
And they turned into it to lodge there .
And when they were come in , they sat in the street of the city , for no man would receive them to lodge .
And behold they saw an old man , returning out of the field and from his work in the evening , and he also was of mount Ephraim , and dwelt as a stranger in Gabaa ; but the men of that country were the children of Jemini .
And the old man lifting up his eyes , saw the man sitting with his <unk> in the street of the city , and said to him : Whence comest thou ?
and whither goest thou ?
He answered him : We came out from Bethlehem Juda , and we are going to our home , which is on the side of mount Ephraim , from whence we went to Bethlehem : and now we go to the house of God , and none will receive us under his roof :
We have straw and hay for <unk> of the asses , and bread and wine for the use of myself and of thy handmaid , and of the servant that is with me : we want nothing but lodging .
And the old man answered him : Peace be with thee : I will furnish all things that are necessary : only I beseech thee , stay not in the street .
And he brought him into his house , and gave <unk> to his asses : and after they had washed their feet , he <unk> them with a feast .
While they were making merry , and <unk> their bodies with meat and drink , after the labour of the journey , the men of that city , sons of Belial ( that is , without yoke ) , came and <unk> the old man ’ s house , and began to <unk> at the door , calling to the master of the house , and saying : Bring forth the man that came into thy house , that we may abuse him :
And the old man went out to them , and said : Do not so , my brethren , do not so wickedly : because this man is come into my lodging , and cease I pray you from this folly .
I have a <unk> daughter , and this man hath a concubine , I will bring them out to you , and you may humble them , and satisfy your lust : only , I beseech you , commit not this crime against nature on the man .
They would not be satisfied with his words ; which the man seeing , brought out his concubine to them , and <unk> her to their wickedness : and when they had abused her all the night , they let her go in the morning .
But the woman , at the <unk> of the day , came to the door of the house , where her lord lodged , and there fell down .
And in the morning the man arose , and opened the door , that he might end the journey he had begun : and behold his concubine lay before the door with her hands spread on the threshold .
He thinking she was taking her rest , said to her : Arise , and let us be going .
But as she made no answer , <unk> she was dead , he took her up , and laid her upon his ass , and returned to his house .
And when he was come home , he took a sword , and divided the dead body of his wife with her bones into twelve parts , and sent the pieces into all the borders of Israel .
And when every one had seen this , they all cried out : There was never such a thing done in Israel , from the day that our fathers came up out of Egypt , until this day : give sentence , and decree in common what ought to be done .
Judges Chapter 20 The Israelites <unk> against Benjamin are twice defeated ; but in the third battle the <unk> are all slain , saving six hundred men .
Then all the children of Israel went out , and gathered together as one man , from Dan to Bersabee , with the land of Galaad , to the Lord in Maspha :
And all the chiefs of the people , and all the tribes of Israel , met together in the assembly of the people of God , four hundred thousand footmen fit for war .
( Nor were the children of Benjamin ignorant that the children of Israel were come up to Maspha . )
And the Levite , the husband of the woman that was killed being asked , how so great a wickedness had been committed ,
<unk> : I came into Gabaa , of Benjamin , with my wife , and there I lodged :
And behold the men of that city , in the night <unk> the house wherein I was , <unk> to kill me , and abused my wife with an <unk> fury of lust , so that at last she died .
And I took her and cut her in pieces , and sent the parts into all the borders of your possession : because there never was so heinous a crime , and so great an abomination committed in Israel .
You are all here , O children of Israel , <unk> what you ought to do .
And all the people standing , answered as by the voice of one man : We will not return to our tents , neither shall any one of us go into his own house :
But this we will do in common against Gabaa :
We will take ten men of a hundred out of all the tribes of Israel , and a hundred out of a thousand , and a thousand out of ten thousand , to bring victuals for the army , that we may fight against Gabaa of Benjamin , and render to it for its wickedness , what it <unk> .
And all Israel were gathered together against the city , as one man , with one mind , and one counsel :
And they sent messengers to all the tribe of Benjamin , to say to them : Why hath so great an abomination been found among you ?
Deliver up the men of Gabaa , that have committed this heinous crime , that they may die , and the evil may be taken away out of Israel .
But they would not hearken to the proposition of their brethren the children of Israel :
But out of all the cities which were of their lot , they gathered themselves together into Gabaa , to aid them , and to fight against the whole people of Israel .
And there were found of Benjamin five and twenty thousand men that drew the sword , besides the inhabitants of Gabaa , 20 : 16 . Who were seven hundred most valiant men , fighting with the left hand as well as with the right : and <unk> stones so sure that they could <unk> even a hair , and not <unk> by the stone ’ s going on either side .
Of the men of Israel also , beside the children of Benjamin , were found four hundred thousand that drew swords and were prepared to fight .
And they arose and came to the house of God , that is , to Silo : and they consulted God , and said : Who shall be in our army the first to go to the battle against the children of Benjamin ?
And the Lord answered them : Let Juda be your leader .
And forthwith the children of Israel rising in the morning , camped by Gabaa :
And going out from thence to fight against Benjamin , began to assault the city .
And the children of Benjamin coming out of Gabaa slew of the children of Israel that day two and twenty thousand men .
Again Israel , trusting in their strength and their number , set their army in array in the same place , where they had fought before : <unk> in their strength ....
The Lord suffered them to be overthrown and many of them to be slain , though their cause was just ; partly in punishment of the idolatry which they exercised or <unk> in the tribe of Dan , and <unk> ; and partly because they trusted in their own strength ; and therefore , though he bid them fight , he would not give them the victory , till they were <unk> humbled and had learned to trust in him alone .
Yet so that they first went up and wept before the Lord until night : and consulted him and said : Shall I go out any more to fight against the children of Benjamin my brethren or not ?
And he answered them : Go up against them , and join battle .
And when the children of Israel went out the next day to fight against the children of Benjamin ,
The children of Benjamin <unk> forth out of the gates of Gabaa : and <unk> them , made so great a slaughter of them , as to kill eighteen thousand men that drew the sword .
Wherefore all the children of Israel came to the house of God , and sat and wept before the Lord : and they fasted that day till the evening , and offered to him holocausts , and victims of peace offerings ,
And inquired of him concerning their state .
At that time the ark of the covenant of the Lord was there ,
And Phinees , the son of Eleazar , the son of Aaron , was over the house .
So they consulted the Lord , and said : Shall we go out any more to fight against the children of Benjamin , our brethren , or shall we cease ?
And the Lord said to them : Go up , for to morrow I will deliver them into your hands .
And the children of Israel set ambushes round about the city of Gabaa :
And they drew up their army against Benjamin the third time , as they had done the first and second .
And the children of Benjamin boldly <unk> out of the city , and seeing their enemies flee , pursued them a long way , so as to wound and kill some of them , as they had done the first and second day , whilst they fled by two <unk> , whereof one goeth up to Bethel and the other to Gabaa , and they slew about thirty men :
For they thought to cut them off as they did before .
But they <unk> <unk> a flight , designed to draw them away from the city , and by their <unk> to flee , to bring them to the <unk> aforesaid .
Then all the children of Israel rising up out of the places where they were , set their army in battle array , in the place which is called <unk> .
The ambushes also , which were about the city , began by little and little to come forth ,
And to march from the west side of the city .
And other ten thousand men chosen out of all Israel , <unk> the inhabitants of the city .
And the battle grew hot against the children of Benjamin : and they understood not that present death threatened them on every side .
And the Lord defeated them before the children of Israel , and they slew of them in that day five and twenty thousand , and one hundred , all fighting men , and that drew the sword .
But the children of Benjamin , when they saw themselves to be too weak , began to flee .
Which the children of Israel seeing , gave them place to flee , that they might come to the ambushes that were prepared , which they had set near the city .
And they that were in ambush arose on a sudden out of their <unk> , and whilst Benjamin turned their backs to the <unk> , went into the city , and smote it with the edge of the sword .
Now the children of Israel had given a sign to them , whom they had laid in ambushes , that after they had taken the city , they should make a fire : that by the smoke rising on high , they might shew that the city was taken .
And when the children of Israel saw this in the battle , ( for the children of Benjamin thought they fled , and pursued them <unk> , killing thirty men of their army )
And perceived , as it were , a pillar of smoke rise up from the city ; and Benjamin looking back , saw that the city was taken , and that the flames ascended on high :
They that before had made as if they fled , turning their faces , stood <unk> against them .
Which the children of Benjamin seeing , turned their backs ,
And began to go towards the way of the desert , the enemy pursuing them thither also .
And they that <unk> the city came also out to meet them .
And so it was , that they were slain on both sides by the enemies , and there was no rest of their men dying .
They fell and were beaten down on the east side of the city of Gabaa .
And they that were slain in the same place , were eighteen thousand men , all most valiant soldiers .
And when they that remained of Benjamin saw this , they fled into the wilderness , and made towards the rock that is called Remmon .
In that flight also , as they were <unk> , and going different ways ; they slew of them five thousand men .
And as they went farther , they still pursued them , and slew also other two thousand .
And so it came to pass , that all that were slain of Benjamin , in divers places , were five and twenty thousand fighting men , most valiant for war .
And there remained of all the number of Benjamin only six hundred men that were able to escape , and flee to the wilderness : and they abode in the rock Remmon four months .
But the children of Israel returning , put all the remains of the city to the sword , both men and beasts , and all the cities and villages of Benjamin were consumed with devouring flames .
Judges Chapter 21 The tribe of Benjamin is saved from being utterly <unk> , by <unk> wives for the six hundred that remained .
Now the children of Israel had also sworn in Maspha , saying : <unk> of us shall give of his daughters to the children of Benjamin to wife .
And they all came to the house of God in Silo , and sitting before him till the evening , lifted up their voices , and began to lament and weep , saying :
O Lord God of Israel , why is so great an evil come to pass in thy people , that this day one tribe should be taken away from among us ?
And rising early the next day , they built an altar : and offered there holocausts , and victims of peace , and they said : 21 : 5 . Who is there among all the tribes of Israel that came not up with the army of the Lord ?
for they had bound themselves with a great oath , when they were in Maspha , that whosoever were wanting should be slain .
And the children of Israel being moved with repentance for their brother Benjamin , began to say : One tribe is taken away from Israel .
Whence shall they take wives ?
For we have all in general sworn , not to give our daughters to them .
Therefore they said : Who is there of all the tribes of Israel , that came not up to the Lord to Maspha ?
And , behold , the inhabitants of Jabes Galaad were found not to have been in that army .
( At that time also when they were in Silo , no one of them was found there , )
So they sent ten thousand of the most valiant men , and commanded them , saying : Go and put the inhabitants of Jabes Galaad to the sword , with their wives and their children .
And this is what you shall observe : Every male , and all women that have known men , you shall kill , but the virgins you shall save .
And there were found of Jabes Galaad four hundred virgins , that had not known the bed of a man , and they brought them to the camp in Silo , into the land of Chanaan .
And they sent messengers to the children of Benjamin , that were in the rock Remmon , and commanded them to receive them in peace .
And the children of Benjamin came at that time , and wives were given them of the daughters of Jabes Galaad : but they found no others , whom they might give in like manner .
And all Israel was very <unk> , and repented for the destroying of one tribe out of Israel .
And the ancients said : What shall we do with the rest , that have not received wives ?
for all the women in Benjamin are dead .
And we must use all care , and provide with great diligence , that one tribe be not destroyed out of Israel .
For as to our own daughters we cannot give them , being bound with an oath and a curse , whereby we said : Cursed be he that shall give Benjamin any of his daughters to wife .
So they took counsel , and said : Behold , there is a <unk> solemnity of the Lord in Silo , which is situate on the north of the city of Bethel , and on the east side of the way , that goeth from Bethel to Sichem , and on the south of the town of <unk> .
And they commanded the children of Benjamin and said : Go , and lie hid in the vineyards ,
And when you shall see the daughters of Silo come out , as the custom is , to <unk> , come ye on a sudden out of the vineyards , and catch you every man his wife among them , and go into the land of Benjamin .
And when their fathers and their brethren shall come , and shall begin to <unk> against you , and to <unk> , we will say to them : Have pity on them : for they took them not away as by the right of war or <unk> , but when they asked to have them , you gave them not , and the fault was committed on your part .
And the children of Benjamin did as they had been commanded : and , according to their number , they carried off for themselves every man his wife of them that were <unk> : and they went into their possession , and built up their cities , and dwelt in them .
The children of Israel also returned by their tribes , and families , to their dwellings .
In those days there was no king in Israel : but every one did that which seemed right to himself .
THE BOOK OF <unk> This Book is called <unk> , from the name of the person whose history is here recorded : who , being a <unk> , became a convert to the true faith , and <unk> Booz , the <unk> of David , was one of those from whom Christ sprung according to the flesh , and an <unk> figure of the <unk> church .
It is thought this book was written by the prophet Samuel .
Ruth Chapter 1 <unk> of Bethlehem going with his wife Noemi , and two sons , into the land of Moab , dieth there .
His sons marry wives of that country and die without issue .
Noemi returneth home with her daughter in law Ruth , who <unk> to part with her .
In the days of one of the judges , when the judges ruled , there came a famine in the land .
And a certain man of Bethlehem Juda , went to sojourn in the land of Moab with his wife and his two sons .
He was named <unk> , and his wife Noemi : and his two sons , the one <unk> , and the other <unk> , <unk> of Bethlehem Juda .
And entering into the country of Moab , they abode there .
And <unk> the husband of Noemi died : and she remained with her sons .
And they took wives of the women of Moab , of which one was called <unk> , and the other Ruth .
And they dwelt there ten years ,
And they both died , to wit , <unk> and <unk> : and the woman was left alone , having lost both her sons and her husband .
And she arose to go from the land of Moab to her own country , with both her daughters in law : for she had heard that the Lord had looked upon his people , and had given them food .
Wherefore she went forth out of the place of her <unk> , with both her daughters in law : and being now in the way to return into the land of Juda ,
She said to them : Go ye home to your mothers , the Lord deal <unk> with you , as you have dealt with the dead and with me .
May he grant you to find rest in the houses of the husbands whom you shall take .
And she kissed them .
And they lifted up their voice , and began to weep ,
And to say : We will go on with thee to thy people .
But she answered them : Return , my daughters : why come ye with me ?
have I any more sons in my womb , that you may hope for husbands of me ?
Return again , my daughters , and go your ways : for I am now spent with age , and not fit for <unk> .
Although I might conceive this night , and bear children ,
If you would wait till they were grown up , and come to man ’ s estate , you would be old women before you marry .
Do not so , my daughters , I beseech you : for I am grieved the more for your distress , and the hand of the Lord is gone out against me .
And they lifted up their voice , and began to weep again : <unk> kissed her mother in law , and returned : Ruth stuck close to her mother in law .
And Noemi said to her : Behold thy <unk> is returned to her people , and to her gods , go thou with her .
To her gods , etc .... Noemi did not mean to persuade Ruth to return to the false gods she had formerly worshipped : but by this manner of speech , <unk> to her , that if she would go with her , she must <unk> her false gods and return to the Lord the God of Israel .
She answered : Be not against me , to desire that I should leave thee and depart : for whithersoever thou shalt go , I will go : and where thou shalt dwell , I also will dwell .
Thy people shall be my people , and thy God my God .
The land that shall receive thee dying , in the same will I die : and there will I be buried .
The Lord do so and so to me , and add more also , if <unk> but death part me and thee .
The Lord do so and so , etc .... A form of <unk> usual in the history of the Old Testament , by which the person <unk> such and such evils to fall upon them , if they did not do what they said .
Then Noemi seeing that Ruth was <unk> determined to go with her , would not be against it , nor persuade her any more to return to her friends :
So they went together , and came to Bethlehem .
And when they were come into the city , the report was quickly spread among all : and the women said : This is that Noemi .
But she said to them : Call me not Noemi ( that is , beautiful , ) but call me <unk> ( that is , bitter ) , for the Almighty hath quite filled me with bitterness .
I went out full and the Lord hath brought me back empty .
Why then do you call me Noemi , whom the Lord hath humbled , and the Almighty hath afflicted ?
So Noemi came with Ruth , the <unk> , her daughter in law , from the land of her <unk> : and returned into Bethlehem , in the beginning of the barley harvest .
Ruth Chapter 2 Ruth <unk> in the field of Booz , who sheweth her favour .
Now her husband <unk> had a kinsman , a powerful man , and very rich , whose name was Booz .
And Ruth , the <unk> , said to her mother in law : If thou wilt , I will go into the field , and <unk> the ears of corn that escape the hands of the reapers , wheresoever I shall find grace with a <unk> , that will be <unk> to me .
And she answered her : Go , my daughter .
She went , therefore , and <unk> the ears of corn after the reapers .
And it happened that the owner of that field was Booz , who was of the kindred of <unk> .
And behold , he came out of Bethlehem , and said to the reapers : The Lord be with you .
And they answered him : The Lord bless thee .
And Booz said to the young man that was set over the reapers : Whose maid is this ?
And he answered him : This is the <unk> , who came with Noemi , from the land of Moab ,
And she desired leave to <unk> the ears of corn that remain , following the steps of the reapers : and she hath been in the field from morning till now , and hath not gone home for one moment .
And Booz said to Ruth : Hear me , daughter , do not go to <unk> in any other field , and do not depart from this place : but keep with my maids ,
And follow where they reap .
For I have charged my young men , not to <unk> thee : and if thou art thirsty , go to the vessels , and drink of the waters whereof the servants drink .
She fell on her face , and worshipping upon the ground , said to him : Whence cometh this to me , that I should find grace before thy eyes , and that thou shouldst <unk> to take notice of me , a woman of another country ?
And he answered her : All hath been told me , that thou hast done to thy mother in law after the death of thy husband : and how thou hast left thy parents , and the land wherein thou wast born , and art come to a people which thou <unk> not heretofore .
The Lord render unto thee for thy work , and mayst thou receive a full reward of the Lord the God of Israel , to whom thou art come , and under whose wings thou art fled .
And she said : I have found grace in thy eyes , my lord , who hast comforted me , and hast spoken to the heart of thy handmaid , who am not like to one of thy maids .
And Booz said to her : At <unk> come thou hither , and eat of the bread , and dip thy morsel in the vinegar .
So she sat at the side of the reapers , and she <unk> to herself <unk> , and ate and was filled , and took the <unk> .
And she arose from thence , to <unk> the ears of corn as before .
And Booz commanded his servants , saying : If she would even reap with you , hinder her not :
And let fall some of your <unk> of purpose , and leave them , that she may gather them without shame , and let no man rebuke her when she gathereth them .
She <unk> therefore in the field till evening : and <unk> out with a rod , and <unk> what she had <unk> , she found about the measure of an ephi of barley , that is , three <unk> :
Which she took up , and returned into the city , and shewed it to her mother in law : moreover , she brought out , and gave her of the remains of her meat , wherewith she had been filled .
And her mother in law said to her : Where hast thou <unk> today , and where hast thou wrought ?
blessed be he that hath had pity on thee .
And she told her with whom she had wrought : and she told the man ’ s name , that he was called Booz .
And Noemi answered her : Blessed be he of the Lord : because the same kindness which he shewed to the living , he hath kept also to the dead .
And again she said : The man is our kinsman .
And Ruth said : He also charged me , that I should keep close to his reapers , till all the corn should be <unk> .
And her mother in law said to her : It is better for thee , my daughter , to go out to reap with his maids , lest in another man ’ s field some one may resist thee .
So she kept close to the maids of Booz : and continued to <unk> with them , till all the barley and the wheat were laid up in the barns .
Ruth Chapter 3 Ruth instructed by her mother in law lieth at Booz ’ s feet , <unk> him for her husband by the law of <unk> : she receiveth a good answer , and six measures of barley .
After she was returned to her mother in law , Noemi said to her : My daughter , I will seek rest for thee , and will provide that it may be well with thee .
This Booz , with whose maids thou wast joined in the field , is our near kinsman , and behold this night he <unk> barley in the <unk> .
<unk> thyself therefore and anoint thee , and put on thy best garments , and go down to the <unk> : but let not the man see thee , till he shall have done eating and drinking .
And when he shall go to sleep , mark the place wherein he sleepeth : and thou shalt go in , and lift up the clothes wherewith he is covered towards his feet , and shalt lay thyself down there : and he will tell thee what thou must do .
She answered : Whatsoever thou shalt command , I will do .
And she went down to the <unk> , and did all that her mother in law had bid her .
And when Booz had eaten , and drunk , and was merry , he went to sleep by the heap of <unk> , and she came <unk> , and <unk> his feet , laid herself down .
And behold , when it was now midnight the man was afraid , and troubled : and he saw a woman lying at his feet ,
And he said to her : Who art thou ?
And she answered : I am Ruth , thy handmaid : spread thy <unk> over thy servant , for thou art a near kinsman .
And he said : Blessed art thou of the Lord , my daughter , and thy latter kindness has <unk> the former : because thou hast not followed young men either poor or rich .
Thy latter kindness , viz .... to thy husband <unk> in seeking to keep up his name and family by <unk> his relation according to the law , and not following after young men .
For Booz , it seems , was then in years .
Fear not therefore , but whatsoever thou shalt say to me I will do to thee .
For all the people that dwell within the gates of my city , know that thou art a <unk> woman .
Neither do I deny myself to be near of <unk> , but there is another nearer than I.
<unk> thou this night : and when morning is come , if he will take thee by the right of kindred , all is well : but if he will not , I will <unk> take thee , as the Lord liveth : sleep till the morning .
So she slept at his feet till the night was going off .
And she arose before men could know one another , and Booz said : Beware lest any man know that thou camest hither .
And again he said : <unk> thy mantle , wherewith thou art covered , and hold it with both hands .
And when she spread it and held it , he measured six measures of barley , and laid it upon her .
And she carried it , and went into the city ,
And came to her mother in law ; who said to her : What hast thou done , daughter ?
And she told her all that the man had done to her .
And she said : Behold he hath given me six measures of barley : for he said : I will not have thee return empty to thy mother in law .
And Noemi said : <unk> , my daughter , till we see what end the thing will have .
For the man will not rest until he have accomplished what he hath said .
Ruth Chapter 4 Upon the <unk> of the nearer kinsman , Booz marrieth Ruth , who bringeth forth Obed , the <unk> of David .
Then Booz went up to the gate , and sat there .
And when he had seen the kinsman going by , of whom he had spoken before , he said to him , calling him by his name : Turn aside for a little while , and sit down here .
He turned aside , and sat down .
And Booz , taking ten men of the ancients of the city , said to them : Sit ye down here .
They sat down , and he spoke to the kinsman : Noemi , who is returned from the country of Moab will sell a <unk> of land that belonged to our brother <unk> .
I would have thee to understand this , and would tell thee before all that sit here , and before the ancients of my people .
If thou wilt take possession of it by the right of kindred : buy it , and possess it : but if it please thee not , tell me so , that I may know what I have to do .
For there is no near kinsman besides thee , who art first , and me , who am second .
But he answered : I will buy the field .
And Booz said to him : When thou shalt buy the field at the woman ’ s hand , thou must take also Ruth , the <unk> , who was the wife of the <unk> : to raise up the name of thy kinsman in his inheritance .
He answered : I yield up my right of next <unk> : for I must not cut off the posterity of my own family .
Do thou make use of my <unk> , which I <unk> I do willingly <unk> .
Now this in former times was the manner in Israel between kinsmen , that if at any time one yielded his right to another : that the grant might be sure , the man put off his <unk> and gave it to his neighbour ; this was a testimony of <unk> of right in Israel .
So Booz said to his kinsman : Put off thy <unk> .
And immediately he took it off from his foot .
And he said to the ancients , and to all the people : You are witnesses this day , that I have bought all that was <unk> ’ s , and <unk> ’ s , and <unk> ’ s , of the hand of Noemi :
And have taken to wife Ruth , the <unk> , the wife of <unk> , to raise up the name of the <unk> in his inheritance lest his name be cut off , from among his family and his brethren and his people .
You , I say , are witnesses of this thing .
Then all the people that were in the gate , and the ancients , answered : We are witnesses : The Lord make this woman who cometh into thy house , like Rachel , and Lia , who built up the house of Israel : that she may be an example of virtue in Ephrata , and may have a famous name in Bethlehem : Ephrata .... Another name of Bethlehem .
And that the house may be , as the house of Phares , whom Thamar bore unto Juda , of the seed which the Lord shall give thee of this young woman .
Booz therefore took Ruth , and married her : and went in unto her , and the Lord gave her to conceive , and to bear a son .
And the women said to Noemi : Blessed be the Lord , who hath not suffered thy family to want a successor : that his name should be preserved in Israel .
And thou shouldst have one to comfort thy soul , and <unk> thy old age .
For he is born of thy daughter in law : who loveth thee : and is much better to thee , than if thou hadst seven sons .
And Noemi taking the child , laid it in her bosom , and she carried it , and was a nurse unto it .
And the women , her neighbours , <unk> with her , and saying , There is a son born to Noemi , called his name Obed : he is the father of Isai , the father of David .
These are the generations of Phares : Phares begot <unk> ,
<unk> begot Aram , Aram begot Aminadab ,
Aminadab begot <unk> , <unk> begot <unk> ,
<unk> begot Booz , Booz begot Obed ,
Obed begot Isai , Isai begot David .
THE FIRST BOOK OF <unk> , <unk> <unk> THE FIRST BOOK OF <unk> This and the following Book are called by the Hebrews the books of Samuel , because they contain the history of Samuel , and of the two kings , Saul and David , whom he anointed .
They are more commonly named by the <unk> , the first and second book of kings .
As to the writer of them , it is the common opinion that Samuel <unk> the first book , as far as the <unk> chapter ; and that the prophets Nathan and Gad finished the first , and wrote the second book .
See 1 Paralipomenon , <unk> 1 <unk> , <unk> .
1 Kings Chapter 1 Anna the wife of Elcana being barren , by vow and prayer <unk> a son : whom she calleth Samuel : and <unk> him to the service of God in Silo , according to her vow .
There was a man of <unk> , of Mount Ephraim , and his name was Elcana , the son of Jeroham , the son of Eliu , the son of <unk> , the son of <unk> , an <unk> : An <unk> ....
He was of the tribe of Levi , 1 .
Par .
<unk> , but is called an <unk> from dwelling in mount Ephraim .
And he had two wives , the name of one was Anna , and the name of the other <unk> .
<unk> had children : but Anna had no children .
And this man went up out of his city upon the appointed days , to adore and to offer sacrifice to the Lord of hosts in Silo .
And the two sons of Heli , <unk> and Phinees , were there priests of the Lord .
Now the day came , and Elcana offered sacrifice , and gave to <unk> , his wife , and to all her sons and daughters , portions :
But to Anna he gave one portion with sorrow , because he loved Anna .
And the Lord had shut up her womb .
Her <unk> also afflicted her , and troubled her exceedingly , insomuch that she <unk> her , that the Lord had shut up her womb :
And thus she did every year , when the time returned , that they went up to the temple of the Lord : and thus she provoked her : but Anna wept , and did not eat .
Then Elcana , her husband , said to her : Anna , why <unk> thou ?
and why dost thou not eat ?
and why dost thou afflict thy heart ?
Am not I better to thee than ten children ?
So Anna arose after she had eaten and drunk in Silo : And Heli , the priest , sitting upon a <unk> before the door of the temple of the Lord ;
As Anna had her heart full of grief , she prayed to the Lord , shedding many tears ,
And she made a vow , saying : O Lord of hosts , if thou wilt look down on the affliction of thy servant , and wilt be mindful of me , and not forget thy handmaid , and wilt give to thy servant a <unk> : I will give him to the Lord all the days of his life , and no <unk> shall come upon his head .
And it came to pass , as she multiplied prayers before the Lord , that Heli observed her mouth .
Now Anna spoke in her heart , and only her lips moved , but her voice was not heard at all .
Heli therefore thought her to be drunk ,
And said to her : How long wilt thou be drunk ?
<unk> a little the wine , of which thou hast taken too much .
Anna answering , said : Not so , my lord : for I am an exceeding unhappy woman , and have drunk neither wine nor any strong drink , but I have poured out my soul before the Lord .
<unk> not thy handmaid for one of the daughters of Belial : for out of the abundance of my sorrow and grief have I spoken till now .
Then Heli said to her : Go in peace : and the God of Israel grant thee thy petition , which thou hast asked of him .
And she said : Would to God thy handmaid may find grace in thy eyes .
So the woman went on her way , and ate , and her countenance was no more changed .
And they rose in the morning , and worshipped before the Lord : and they returned , and came into their house at Ramatha .
And Elcana knew Anna his wife : And the Lord remembered her .
And it came to pass when the time was come about , Anna conceived and bore a son , and called his name Samuel : because she had asked him of the Lord .
Samuel ....
This name <unk> , asked of God .
And Elcana , her husband , went up , and all his house , to offer to the Lord the solemn sacrifice , and his vow .
But Anna went not up : for she said to her husband : I will not go till the child be <unk> , and till I may carry him , that he may appear before the Lord , and may abide always there .
And Elcana , her husband , said to her : Do what seemeth good to thee , and stay till thou <unk> him : and I pray that the Lord may fulfil his word .
So the woman <unk> at home , and gave her son suck , till she <unk> him .
And after she had <unk> him , she carried him with her , with three calves , and three <unk> of flour , and a bottle of wine , and she brought him to the house of the Lord in Silo .
Now the child was as yet very young :
And they immolated a calf , and offered the child to Heli .
And Anna said : I beseech thee , my lord , as thy soul liveth , my lord : I am that woman , who stood before thee here praying to the Lord .
For this child did I pray , and the Lord hath granted me my petition , which I asked of him .
Therefore I also have lent him to the Lord all the days of his life , he shall be lent to the Lord .
And they adored the Lord there .
And Anna prayed , and said : 1 Kings Chapter 2 The canticle of Anna .
The wickedness of the sons of Heli : for which they are not <unk> corrected by their father .
A prophecy against the house of Heli .
My heart hath rejoiced in the Lord , and my horn is exalted in my God : my mouth is enlarged over my enemies : because I have <unk> in thy salvation .
My horn ....
The horn in the scriptures signifies strength , power , the horn is said to be exalted , when a person <unk> an increase of strength or glory .
There is none holy as the Lord is : for there is no other beside thee , and there is none strong like our God .
Do not multiply to speak lofty things , boasting : let old matters depart from your mouth : for the Lord is a God of all knowledge , and to him are thoughts prepared .
The bow of the mighty is overcome , and the weak are <unk> with strength .
They that were full before , have hired out themselves for bread : and the hungry are filled , so that the barren hath borne many : and she that had many children is weakened .
The Lord killeth and maketh alive , he bringeth down to hell , and bringeth back again .
The Lord maketh poor and maketh rich , he <unk> and he exalteth :
He <unk> up the needy from the dust , and lifteth up the poor from the <unk> : that he may sit with princes , and hold the throne of glory .
For the <unk> of the earth are the Lord ’ s , and upon them he hath set the world .
He will keep the feet of his saints , and the wicked shall be silent in darkness ; because no man shall prevail by his own strength .
The adversaries of the Lord shall fear him : and upon them shall he thunder in the heavens : The Lord shall judge the ends of the earth , and he shall give empire to his king , and shall exalt the horn of his Christ .
And Elcana went to Ramatha , to his house : but the child ministered in the sight of the Lord before the face of Heli the priest .
Now the sons of Heli were children of Belial , not knowing the Lord ,
Nor the office of the priests to the people : but whosoever had offered a sacrifice , the servant of the priest came , while the flesh was in <unk> , with a <unk> of three teeth in his hand ,
And thrust it into the <unk> , or into the <unk> , or into the pot , or into the <unk> : and all that the <unk> brought up , the priest took to himself .
Thus did they to all Israel that came to Silo .
Also before they burnt the fat , the servant of the priest came , and said to the man that sacrificed : Give me flesh to boil for the priest : for I will not take of thee <unk> flesh , but <unk> .
And he that sacrificed said to him : Let the fat first be burnt to day , according to the custom , and then take to thee as much as thy soul desireth .
But he answered , and said to him : Not so : but thou shalt give it me now , or else I will take it by force .
Wherefore the sin of the young men was exceeding great before the Lord : because they <unk> men from the sacrifice of the Lord .
But Samuel ministered before the face of the Lord : being a child girded with a linen ephod .
And his mother made him a little coat , which she brought to him on the appointed days , when she went up with her husband , to offer the solemn sacrifice .
And Heli blessed Elcana and his wife : and he said to him : The Lord give thee seed of this woman , for the <unk> thou hast lent to the Lord .
And they went to their own home .
And the Lord visited Anna , and she conceived , and bore three sons , and two daughters : and the child Samuel became great before the Lord .
Now Heli was very old , and he heard all that his sons did to all Israel : and how they lay with the women that waited at the door of the tabernacle :
And he said to them : Why do ye these kinds of things , which I hear , very wicked things , from all the people ?
Do not so , my sons : for it is no good report that I hear , that you make the people of the Lord to transgress .
If one man shall sin against another , God may be appeased in his behalf : but if a man shall sin against the Lord , who shall pray for him ?
And they hearkened not to the voice of their father , because the Lord would slay them .
Who shall pray for him .... By this word Heli would have his sons understand , that by their wicked abuse of sacred things , and of the very sacrifices which were appointed to <unk> the Lord , they deprived themselves of the <unk> means of reconciliation with God ; which was by sacrifices .
The more , because they were the chief priests whose business it was to <unk> for all others , they had no other to offer sacrifices and to make atonement for them .
Ibid .
Because the Lord would slay them ....
In consequence of their manifold <unk> , he would not <unk> their hearts with his <unk> grace , but was determined to destroy them .
But the child Samuel advanced , and grew on , and pleased both the Lord and men .
And there came a man of God to Heli , and said to him : Thus saith the Lord : Did I not plainly appear to thy father ’ s house , when they were in Egypt in the house of Pharao ?
And I chose him out of all the tribes of Israel to be my priest , to go up to my altar , and burn incense to me , and to wear the ephod before me : and I gave to thy father ’ s house of all the sacrifices of the children of Israel .
Why have you <unk> away my victims , and my gifts which I commanded to be offered in the temple : and thou hast rather honoured thy sons than me , to eat the firstfruits of every sacrifice of my people Israel ?
Wherefore thus saith the Lord the God of Israel : I said indeed that thy house , and the house of thy father , should minister in my sight , for ever .
But now saith the Lord : <unk> be this from me : but whosoever shall glorify me , him will I glorify : but they that despise me , shall be despised .
Behold the days come : and I will cut off thy arm , and the arm of thy father ’ s house , that there shall not be an old man in thy house .
And thou shalt see thy <unk> in the temple , in all the prosperity of Israel , and there shall not be an old man in thy house for ever .
Thy <unk> .... A priest of another race .
This was partly fulfilled , when Abiathar , of the race of Heli , was removed from the priesthood , and Sadoc , who was of another line , was <unk> in his place .
But it was more fully accomplished in the New Testament , when the priesthood of Aaron gave place to that of Christ .
However , I will not altogether take away a man of thee from my altar : but that thy eyes may faint , and thy soul be spent : and a great part of thy house shall die , when they come to man ’ s estate .
And this shall be a sign to thee , that shall come upon thy two sons , <unk> and Phinees : in one day they shall both of them die .
And I will raise me up a faithful priest , who shall do according to my heart , and my soul and I will build him a faithful house , and he shall walk all days before my anointed .
And it shall come to pass , that whosoever shall remain in thy house shall come that he may be prayed for , and shall offer a piece of silver , and a <unk> of bread , and shall say : Put me , I beseech thee , to somewhat of the priestly office , that I may eat a morsel of bread .
1 Kings Chapter 3 Samuel is four times called by the Lord : who <unk> to him the evil that shall fall on Heli , and his house .
Now the child Samuel ministered to the Lord before Heli , and the word of the Lord was precious in those days , there was no manifest vision .
<unk> .... That is , <unk> .
And it came to pass one day when Heli lay in his place , and his eyes were grown dim , that he could not see :
Before the lamp of God went out , Samuel slept in the temple of the Lord , where the ark of God was .
And the Lord called Samuel .
And he answered : Here am I.
And he ran to Heli , and said : Here am I : for thou didst call me .
He said : I did not call : go back and sleep .
And he went and slept .
And the Lord called Samuel again .
And Samuel arose and went to Heli , and said : Here am I : for thou <unk> me .
He answered : I did not call thee , my son : return and sleep .
Now Samuel did not yet know the Lord , neither had the word of the Lord been revealed to him .
And the Lord called Samuel again the third time .
And he arose up and went to Heli ,
And said : Here am I : for thou didst call me .
Then Heli understood that the Lord called the child , and he said to Samuel : Go , and sleep : and if he shall call thee any more , thou shalt say : Speak , Lord , for thy servant heareth .
So Samuel went , and slept in his place .
And the Lord came , and stood , and he called , as he had called the other times , Samuel , Samuel .
And Samuel said : Speak , Lord , for thy servant heareth .
And the Lord said to Samuel : Behold I do a thing in Israel : and whosoever shall hear it , both his ears shall <unk> .
In that day I will raise up against Heli all the things I have spoken concerning his house : I will begin , and I will make an end .
For I have foretold unto him , that I will judge his house for ever , for iniquity , because he knew that his sons did wickedly , and did not chastise them .
Therefore have I sworn to the house of Heli , that the iniquity of his house shall not be <unk> with victims nor offerings for ever .
And Samuel slept till morning , and opened the doors of the house of the Lord .
And Samuel feared to tell the vision to Heli .
Then Heli called Samuel , and said : Samuel , my son .
And he answered : Here am I.
And he asked him : What is the word that the Lord hath spoken to thee ?
I beseech thee hide it not from me .
May God do so and so to thee , and add so and so , if thou hide from me one word of all that were said to thee .
So Samuel told him all the words , and did not hide them from him .
And he answered : It is the Lord : let him do what is good in his sight .
And Samuel grew , and the Lord was with him , and not one of his words fell to the ground .
And all Israel , from Dan to Bersabee , knew that Samuel was a faithful prophet of the Lord .
And the Lord again appeared in Silo , for the Lord revealed himself to Samuel in Silo , according to the word of the Lord .
And the word of Samuel came to pass to all Israel .
1 Kings Chapter 4 The Israelites being overcome by the Philistines , send for the ark of God : but they are beaten again , the sons of Heli are killed , and the ark taken : upon the hearing of the news Heli falleth backward and dieth .
And it came to pass in those days , that the Philistines gathered themselves together to fight : and Israel went out to war against the Philistines , and camped by the <unk> of help .
And the Philistines came to <unk> , The <unk> of help ....
In Hebrew <unk> ; so called from the help which the Lord was pleased afterwards to give to his people Israel in that place , by the prayers of Samuel , chap .
<unk> .
And put their army in array against Israel .
And when they had joined battle , Israel turned their backs to the Philistines : and there were slain in that fight , here and there in the fields , about four thousand men .
And the people returned to the camp : and the ancients of Israel said : Why hath the Lord defeated us to day before the Philistines ?
Let us fetch unto us the ark of the covenant of the Lord from Silo , and let it come in the midst of us , that it may save us from the hand of our enemies .
So the people sent to Silo , and they brought from thence the ark of the covenant of the Lord of hosts , sitting upon the cherubims : and the two sons of Heli , <unk> and Phinees , were with the ark of the covenant of God .
And when the ark of the covenant of the Lord was come into the camp , all Israel shouted with a great shout , and the earth <unk> again .
And the Philistines heard the noise of the shout , and they said : What is this noise of a great shout in the camp of the Hebrews ?
And they understood that the ark of the Lord was come into the camp .
And the Philistines were afraid , saying : God is come into the camp .
And <unk> , they said :
Woe to us : for there was no such great joy yesterday , and the day before : Woe to us .
Who shall deliver us from the hand of these high Gods ?
these are the Gods that struck Egypt with all the plagues in the desert .
Take courage , and behave like men , ye Philistines : lest you come to be servants to the Hebrews , as they have served you : take courage and fight .
So the Philistines fought , and Israel was overthrown , and every man fled to his own dwelling : and there was an exceeding great slaughter ; for there fell of Israel thirty thousand footmen .
And the ark of God was taken : and the two sons of Heli , <unk> and Phinees , were slain .
And there ran a man of Benjamin out of the army , and came to Silo the same day , with his clothes rent , and his head <unk> with dust .
And when he was come , Heli sat upon a <unk> over against the way , watching .
For his heart was fearful for the ark of God .
And when the man was come into the city , he told it : and all the city cried out .
And Heli heard the noise of the cry , and he said : What meaneth the noise of this <unk> ?
But he made haste , and came , and told Heli .
Now Heli was ninety and eight years old , and his eyes were dim , and he could not see .
And he said to Heli : I am he that came from the battle , and have fled out of the field this day .
And he said to him : What is there done , my son ?
And he that brought the news answered , and said : Israel is fled before the Philistines , and there has been a great slaughter of the people : moreover thy two sons , <unk> and Phinees , are dead : and the ark of God is taken .
And when he had named the ark of God , he fell from his <unk> <unk> by the door , and broke his neck and died .
For he was an old man , and far advanced in years : And he judged Israel forty years .
<unk> the ark , etc ....
There is great reason , by all these <unk> , to hope that Heli died in a state of grace ; and by his temporal punishments escaped the eternal .
And his daughter in law , the wife of Phinees , was <unk> with child , and near her time : and hearing the news that the ark of God was taken , and her father in law , and her husband , were dead , she bowed herself and fell in labour : for her pains came upon her on a sudden .
And when she was upon the point of death , they that stood about her said to her : Fear not , for thou hast borne a son .
She answered them not , nor gave heed to them .
And she called the child <unk> , saying : The glory is gone from Israel , because the ark of God was taken , and for her father in law , and for her husband : <unk> .... That is , Where is the glory ?
or , there is no glory .
We see how much the Israelites lamented the loss of the ark , which was but the <unk> of God ’ s presence among them .
How much more ought Christians to lament the loss of God himself , when by sin they have driven him out of their souls .
And she said : The glory is departed from Israel , because the ark of God was taken .
1 Kings Chapter 5 Dagon twice falleth down before the ark .
The Philistines are grievously afflicted , <unk> the ark cometh .
And the Philistines took the ark of God , and carried it from the <unk> of help into Azotus .
And the Philistines took the ark of God , and brought it into the temple of Dagon , and set it by Dagon .
And when the <unk> arose early the next day , behold Dagon lay upon his face on the ground before the ark of the Lord : and they took Dagon , and set him again in his place .
And the next day again , when they rose in the morning , they found Dagon lying upon his face on the earth before the ark of the Lord : and the head of Dagon , and both the <unk> of his hands , were cut off upon the threshold :
And only the <unk> of Dagon remained in its place .
For this cause neither the priests of Dagon , nor any that go into the temple , tread on the threshold of Dagon in Azotus unto this day .
And the hand of the Lord was heavy upon the <unk> , and he destroyed them , and afflicted Azotus and the coasts thereof with <unk> .
And in the villages and fields in the midst of that country , there came forth a multitude of <unk> , and there was the confusion of a great <unk> in the city .
And the men of Azotus seeing this kind of plague , said : The ark of the God of Israel shall not stay with us : for his hand is heavy upon us , and upon Dagon , our god .
And sending , they gathered together all the lords of the Philistines to them , and said : What shall we do with the ark of the God of Israel ?
And the <unk> answered : Let the ark of the God of Israel be carried about .
And they carried the ark of the God of Israel about .
And while they were carrying it about , the hand of the Lord came upon every city with an exceeding great slaughter : and he smote the men of every city , both small and great , and they had <unk> in their secret parts .
And the <unk> consulted together , and made themselves seats of skins .
Therefore they sent the ark of God into Accaron .
And when the ark of God was come into Accaron , the <unk> cried out , saying : They have brought the ark of the God of Israel to us , to kill us and our people .
They sent therefore , and gathered together all the lords of the Philistines : and they said : Send away the ark of the God of Israel , and let it return into its own place , and not kill us and our people .
For there was the fear of death in every city , and the hand of God was exceeding heavy .
The men also that did not die , were afflicted with the <unk> : and the cry of every city went up to heaven .
1 Kings Chapter 6 The ark is sent back to Bethsames : where many are slain for looking through <unk> into it .
Now the ark of God was in the land of the Philistines seven months .
And the Philistines called for the priests and the diviners , saying : What shall we do with the ark of the Lord ?
tell us how we are to send it back to its place .
And they said :
If you send back the ark of the God of Israel , send it not away empty , but render unto him what you <unk> for sin , and then you shall be healed : and you shall know why his hand <unk> not from you .
They answered : What is it we ought to render unto him for sin ?
and they answered :
According to the number of the provinces of the Philistines you shall make five golden <unk> , and five golden <unk> : for the same plague hath been upon you all , and upon your lords .
And you shall make the likeness of your <unk> , and the likeness of the <unk> , that have destroyed the land , and you shall give glory to the God of Israel : to see if he will take off his hand from you , and from your gods , and from your land .
Why do you harden your hearts , as Egypt and Pharao hardened their hearts ?
did not he , after he was struck , then let them go , and they departed ?
Now , therefore , take and make a new cart : and two kine that have <unk> , on which there hath come no yoke , <unk> to the cart , and shut up their calves at home .
And you shall take the ark of the Lord , and lay it on the cart , and the vessels of gold , which you have paid him for sin , you shall put into a little box at the side thereof : and send it away , that it may go .
And you shall look : and if it go up by the way of his own coasts , towards Bethsames , then he hath done us this great evil : but if not , we shall know that it is not his hand hath touched us , but it hath happened by <unk> .
They did therefore in this manner : and taking two kine , that had <unk> calves , they <unk> them to the cart , and shut up their calves at home .
And they laid the ark of God upon the cart , and the little box that had in it the golden <unk> , and the likeness of the <unk> .
And the kine took the straight way , that leadeth to Bethsames , and they went along the way , <unk> as they went : and turned not aside neither to the right hand nor to the left : and the lords of the Philistines followed them as far as the borders of Bethsames .
Now the <unk> were <unk> wheat in the valley : and lifting up their eyes , they saw the ark , and rejoiced to see it .
And the cart came into the field of Josue , a <unk> , and stood there .
And there was a great stone , and they cut in pieces the wood of the cart , and laid the kine upon it a holocaust to the Lord .
And the Levites took down the ark of God , and the little box that was at the side of it , wherein were the vessels of gold , and they put them upon the great stone .
The men also of Bethsames offered holocausts , and sacrificed victims that day to the Lord .
And the five princes of the Philistines saw , and they returned to Accaron the same day .
And these are the golden <unk> , which the Philistines returned for sin to the Lord : For Azotus one , for Gaza one , for Ascalon one , for Geth one , for Accaron one :
And the golden <unk> , according to the number of the cities of the Philistines , of the five provinces , from the fenced city to the <unk> that was without wall , and to the great Abel ( the stone ) <unk> they set down the ark of the Lord , which was till that day in the field of Josue the <unk> .
But he slew of the men of Bethsames , because they had seen the ark of the Lord , and he slew of the people seventy men , and fifty thousand of the common people .
And the people lamented , because the Lord had smitten the people with a great slaughter .
<unk> .... And <unk> looked into .
It is <unk> this plague reached to all the neighbouring country , as well as the city of Bethsames .
And the men of Bethsames said : Who shall be able to stand before the Lord this holy God ?
and to whom shall he go up from us ?
And they sent messengers to the inhabitants of Cariathiarim , saying : The Philistines have brought back the ark of the Lord , come ye down and fetch it up to you .
1 Kings Chapter 7 The ark is brought to Cariathiarim .
By Samuel ’ s exhortation the people cast away their idols and serve God alone .
The Lord <unk> the Philistines , while Samuel offereth sacrifice .
And the men of Cariathiarim came , and <unk> up the ark of the Lord , and carried it into the house of Abinadab , in Gabaa : and they sanctified Eleazar , his son , to keep the ark of the Lord .
In Gabaa .... That is , on the hill , for Gabaa signifieth a hill .
And it came to pass , that from the day the ark of the Lord abode in Cariathiarim , days were multiplied ( for it was now the twentieth year ) and all the house of Israel rested , following the Lord .
And Samuel spoke to all the house of Israel , saying : If you turn to the Lord with all your heart , put away the strange gods from among you , Baalim and Astaroth : and prepare your hearts unto the Lord , and serve him only , and he will deliver you out of the hand of the Philistines .
Then the children of Israel put away Baalim and Astaroth , and served the Lord only .
And Samuel said : Gather all Israel to Masphath , that I may pray to the Lord for you .
And they gathered together to Masphath , and they drew water , and poured it out before the Lord , and they fasted on that day , and they said there : We have sinned against the Lord .
And Samuel judged the children of Israel in Masphath .
And the Philistines heard that the children of Israel were gathered together to Masphath , and the lords of the Philistines went up against Israel .
And when the children of Israel heard this , they were afraid of the Philistines .
And they said to Samuel : <unk> not to cry to the Lord our God for us , that he may save us out of the hand of the Philistines .
And Samuel took a <unk> lamb , and offered it whole for a holocaust to the Lord : and Samuel cried to the Lord for Israel , and the Lord heard him .
And it came to pass , when Samuel was offering the holocaust , the Philistines began the battle against Israel : but the Lord <unk> with a great thunder on that day upon the Philistines , and terrified them , and they were overthrown before the face of Israel .
And the men of Israel going out of Masphath , pursued after the Philistines , and made slaughter of them till they came under <unk> .
And Samuel took a stone , and laid it between Masphath and <unk> : and he called the place The stone of help .
And he said : Thus far the Lord hath helped us .
And the Philistines were humbled , and they did not come any more into the borders of Israel .
And the hand of the Lord was against the Philistines , all the days of Samuel .
And the cities which the Philistines had taken from Israel , were restored to Israel , from Accaron to Geth , and their borders : and he delivered Israel from the hand of the Philistines , and there was peace between Israel and the Amorrhites .
And Samuel judged Israel all the days of his life :
And he went every year about to Bethel and to Galgal and to Masphath , and he judged Israel in the <unk> places .
And he returned to Ramatha : for there was his house , and there he judged Israel : he built also there an altar to the Lord .
1 Kings Chapter 8 Samuel growing old , and his sons not walking in his ways , the people desire a king .
And it came to pass , when Samuel was old , that he appointed his sons to be judges over Israel .
Now the name of his firstborn son was Joel : and the name of the second was Abia , judges in Bersabee .
And his sons walked not in his ways : but they turned aside after <unk> , and took bribes , and <unk> judgment .
Then all the ancients of Israel being assembled came to Samuel to Ramatha .
And they said to him : Behold thou art old , and thy sons walk not in thy ways : make us a king , to judge us , as all nations have .
And the word was <unk> in the eyes of Samuel , that they should say : Give us a king to judge us .
And Samuel prayed to the Lord .
And the Lord said to Samuel : Hearken to the voice of the people in all that they say to thee .
For they have not rejected thee , but me , that I should not reign over them .
<unk> , etc ....
The government of Israel <unk> had been a <unk> , in which God himself immediately ruled , by laws which he had <unk> , and by judges <unk> raised up by himself ; and therefore he <unk> that his people rejected him , in desiring a change of government .
According to all their works , they have done from the day that I brought them out of Egypt until this day : as they have forsaken me , and served strange gods , so do they also unto thee .
Now , therefore , hearken to their voice : but yet testify to them , and <unk> them the right of the king , that shall reign over them .
The right .... That is , the manner ( <unk> ) after which he shall proceed , having no one to <unk> him , when he has the power in his hand .
Then Samuel told all the words of the Lord to the people that had desired a king of him ,
And said : This will be the right of the king that shall reign over you : He will take your sons , and put them in his chariots , and will make them his horsemen , and his running footmen , to run before his chariots ,
And he will appoint of them to be his tribunes , and his centurions , and to plough his fields , and to reap his corn , and to make him arms and chariots .
Your daughters also he will take to make him ointments , and to be his <unk> , and <unk> .
And he will take your fields , and your vineyards , and your best <unk> , and give them to his servants .
Moreover he will take the tenth of your corn , and of the revenues of your vineyards , to give to his eunuchs and servants .
Your servants also , and handmaids , and your <unk> young men , and your asses , he will take away , and put them to his work .
Your flocks also he will <unk> , and you shall be his servants .
And you shall cry out in that day from the face of the king , whom you have chosen to yourselves : and the Lord will not hear you in that day , because you desired unto yourselves a king .
But the people would not hear the voice of Samuel , and they said , <unk> : but there shall be a king over us ,
And we also will be like all nations : and our king shall judge us , and go out before us , and fight our battles for us .
And Samuel heard all the words of the people , and <unk> them in the ears of the Lord .
And the Lord said to Samuel : Hearken to their voice , and make them a king .
And Samuel said to the men of Israel : Let every man go to his city .
1 Kings Chapter 9 Saul seeking his father ’ s asses , cometh to Samuel , by whom he is <unk> .
Now there was a man of Benjamin , whose name was Cis , the son of <unk> , the son of <unk> , the son of <unk> , the son of <unk> , the son of a man of Jemini , valiant and strong .
And he had a son whose name was Saul , a choice and goodly man , and there was not among the children of Israel a <unk> person than he : from his shoulders and upward he appeared above all the people .
And the asses of Cis , Saul ’ s father , were lost : and Cis said to his son Saul : Take one of the servants with thee , and arise , go , and seek the asses .
And when they had passed through Mount Ephraim ,
And through the land of <unk> , and had not found them , they passed also through the land of <unk> , and they were not there : and through the land of Jemini , and found them not .
And when they were come to the land of <unk> , Saul said to the servant that was with him : Come , let us return , lest perhaps my father forget the asses , and be <unk> for us .
And he said to him : Behold there is a man of God in this city , a famous man : all that he saith , cometh certainly to pass .
Now , therefore , let us go thither , perhaps he may tell us of our way , for which we are come .
And Saul said to his servant : Behold we will go : but what shall we carry to the man of God ?
the bread is spent in our <unk> : and we have no present to make to the man of God , nor any thing at all .
The servant answered Saul again , and said : Behold there is found in my hand the fourth part of a sicle of silver , let us give it to the man of God , that he may tell us our way .
Now in time past in Israel , when a man went to consult God , he spoke thus : Come , let us go to the seer .
For he that is now called a prophet , in time past was called a seer .
<unk> .... Because of his seeing by divine light hidden things and things to come .
And Saul said to his servant : Thy word is very good , come let us go .
And they went into the city , where the man of God was .
And when they went up the ascent to the city , they found maids coming out to draw water , and they said to them : Is the seer here ?
They answered and said to them : He is : behold he is before you , make haste now : for he came to day into the city , for there is a sacrifice of the people to day in the high place .
A sacrifice ....
The law did not allow of sacrifices in any other place , but at the tabernacle , or temple , in which the ark of the covenant was kept ; but Samuel , by divine dispensation , offered sacrifices in other places .
For which dispensation this reason may be <unk> , that the house of God in Silo , having lost the ark , was now cast off ; as a figure of the <unk> of the Jews , <unk> .
<unk> , 67 .
And in Cariathiarim where the ark was , there was neither tabernacle , nor altar . — Ibid .
The high place .... <unk> .
The <unk> , or high places , so often mentioned in scripture , were places of worship , in which were altars for sacrifice .
These were sometimes employed in the service of the true God , as in the present case : but more <unk> in the service of idols ; and were called <unk> , which is commonly ( though perhaps not so <unk> ) rendered high places ; not because they were always upon hills , for the very <unk> of all , which was that of Topheth , or <unk> , ( Jer .
19 . )
was in a valley ; but because of the high altars , and pillars , or <unk> , erected there , on which were set up the idols , or <unk> of their <unk> .
As soon as you come into the city , you shall immediately find him , before he go up to the high place to eat : for the people will not eat till he come ; because he blesseth the victim , and afterwards they eat that are invited .
Now , therefore , go up , for to day you shall find him .
And they went up into the city .
And when they were walking in the midst of the city , behold Samuel was coming out over against them , to go up to the high place .
Now the Lord had revealed to the ear of Samuel the day before Saul came , saying :
To morrow about this same hour I will send thee a man of the land of Benjamin , and thou shalt anoint him to be ruler over my people Israel : and he shall save my people out of the hand of the Philistines : for I have looked down upon my people , because their cry is come to me .
And when Samuel saw Saul , the Lord said to him : Behold the man , of whom I spoke to thee , this man shall reign over my people .
And Saul came to Samuel in the midst of the gate , and said : Tell me , I pray thee , where is the house of the seer ?
And Samuel answered Saul , saying : I am the seer ; go up before me to the high place , that you may eat with me to day , and I will let thee go in the morning : and tell thee all that is in thy heart .
And as for the asses , which were lost three days ago , be not solicitous , because they are found .
And for whom shall be all the best things of Israel ?
Shall they not be for thee and for all thy father ’ s house ?
And Saul answering , said : Am not I a son of Jemini of the least tribe of Israel , and my kindred the last among all the families of the tribe of Benjamin ?
Why then hast thou spoken this word to me ?
Then Samuel taking Saul , and his servant , brought them into the <unk> , and gave them a place at the head of them that were invited .
For there were about thirty men .
And Samuel said to the <unk> : Bring the portion which I gave thee , and commanded thee to set it apart by thee .
And the <unk> took up the shoulder , and set it before Saul .
And Samuel said : Behold what is left , set it before thee , and eat ; because it was kept of purpose for thee , when I invited the people .
And Saul ate with Samuel that day .
And they went down from the high place into the town , and he spoke with Saul upon the top of the house : and he prepared a bed for Saul on the top of the house and he slept .
And when they were risen in the morning , and it began now to be light , Samuel called Saul on the top of the house , saying : Arise , that I may let thee go .
And Saul arose : and they went out both of them : to wit , he and Samuel .
And as they were going down in the end of the city , Samuel said to Saul : Speak to the servant to go before us , and pass on : but stand thou still a while , that I may tell thee the word of the Lord .
1 Kings Chapter 10 Saul is anointed .
He prophesieth , and is changed into another man .
Samuel calleth the people together , to make a king : the lot falleth on Saul .
And Samuel took a little <unk> of oil , and poured it upon his head , and kissed him , and said : Behold , the Lord hath anointed thee to be prince over his inheritance , and thou shalt deliver his people out of the hands of their enemies , that are round about them .
And this shall be a sign unto thee , that God hath anointed thee to be prince .
When thou shalt depart from me this day , thou shalt find two men by the sepulchre of Rachel in the borders of Benjamin to the south , and they shall say to thee : The asses are found which thou <unk> to seek : and thy father , thinking no more of the asses , is <unk> for you , and saith : What shall I do for my son ?
And when thou shalt depart from thence , and go farther on , and shalt come to the oak of Thabor , there shall meet thee three men going up to God to Bethel , one carrying three kids , and another three loaves of bread , and another carrying a bottle of wine .
Bethel .... Where there was at that time an altar of God ; it being one of the places where Samuel judged Israel .
And they will salute thee , and will give thee two loaves , and thou shalt take them at their hand .
After that thou shalt come to the hill of God , where the garrison of the Philistines is : and when thou shalt be come there into the city , thou shalt meet a company of prophets coming down from the high place , with a psaltery , and a <unk> , and a <unk> , and a harp before them , and they shall be prophesying .
The hill of God .... Gabaa , in which there was also at that time , a high place or altar . — <unk> ....
These were men whose office it was to sing hymns and praises to God ; for such in holy writ are called prophets , and their singing praises to God is called prophesying .
See 1 Par .
<unk> 1 <unk> .
<unk> , and <unk> .
Now there were in those days <unk> , or <unk> for <unk> up these prophets ; and it seems there was one of these <unk> at this hill of God ; and another at <unk> in Ramatha .
See 1 Kings <unk> , 21 , etc .
And the Spirit of the Lord shall come upon thee , and thou shalt prophesy with them , and shalt be changed into another man .
When therefore these signs shall happen to thee , do whatsoever thy hand shall find , for the Lord is with thee .
And thou shalt go down before me to Galgal , ( for I will come down to thee ) , that thou mayst offer an oblation , and sacrifice victims of peace : seven days shalt thou wait , till I come to thee , and I will shew thee what thou art to do .
Galgal ....
Here also by dispensation was an altar of God .
So when he had turned his back to go from Samuel , God gave unto him another heart , and all these things came to pass that day .
And they came to the <unk> hill , and behold a company of prophets met him : and the Spirit of the Lord came upon him , and he prophesied in the midst of them .
And all that had known him yesterday and the day before , seeing that he was with the prophets , and prophesied , said to each other : What is this that hath happened to the son of Cis ?
is Saul also among the prophets ?
And one answered another , saying : And who is their father ?
therefore it became a proverb : Is Saul also among the prophets ?
Their father .... That is , their teacher , or <unk> .
As much as to say , Who could bring about such a wonderful change as to make Saul a prophet ?
And when he had made an end of prophesying , he came to the high place .
And Saul ’ s uncle said to him , and to his servant : Whither went you ?
They answered : To seek the asses : and not finding them , we went to Samuel .
And his uncle said to him : Tell me what Samuel said to thee .
And Saul said to his uncle : He told us that the asses were found .
But of the matter of the kingdom of which Samuel had spoken to him , he told him not .
And Samuel called together the people to the Lord in Maspha :
And he said to the children of Israel : Thus saith the Lord the God of Israel : I brought up Israel out of Egypt , and delivered you from the hand of the Egyptians , and from the hand of all the kings who afflicted you .
But you this day have rejected your God , who only hath saved you out of all your evils and your tribulations : and you have said : <unk> : but set a king over us .
Now therefore stand before the Lord by your tribes , and by your families .
And Samuel brought to him all the tribes of Israel , and the lot fell on the tribe of Benjamin .
And he brought the tribe of Benjamin and the kindreds thereof , and the lot fell upon the kindred of <unk> , and it came to Saul , the son of Cis .
They sought him therefore , and he was not found .
And after this they consulted the Lord whether he would come thither .
And the Lord answered : Behold he is hidden at home .
And they ran and <unk> him thence : and he stood in the midst of the people , and he was higher than any of the people from the shoulders and upward .
And Samuel said to all the people : Surely you see him whom the Lord hath chosen , that there is none like him among all the people .
And all the people cried and said : God save the king .
And Samuel told the people the law of the kingdom , and wrote it in a book , and laid it up before the Lord : and Samuel sent away all the people , every one to his own house .
Saul also departed to his own house in Gabaa : and there went with him a part of the army , whose hearts God had touched .
But the children of Belial said : Shall this fellow be able to save us ?
And they despised him , and brought him no presents ; but he <unk> as though he heard not .
1 Kings Chapter 11 Saul <unk> the Ammonites , and <unk> Jabes Galaad .
And it came to pass about a month after this , that <unk> , the <unk> , came up , and began to fight against Jabes Galaad .
And all the men of Jabes said to <unk> : Make a covenant with us , and we will serve thee .
And <unk> , the <unk> , answered them : On this condition will I make a covenant with you , that I may pluck out all your right eyes , and make you a reproach in all Israel .
And the ancients of Jabes said to him : <unk> us seven days , that we may send messengers to all the coasts of Israel : and if there be no one to defend us , we will come out to thee .
The messengers therefore came to Gabaa of Saul : and they spoke these words in the hearing of the people : and all the people lifted up their voices , and wept .
And behold Saul came , following oxen out of the field , and he said : What <unk> the people that they weep ?
And they told him the words of the men of Jabes .
And the Spirit of the Lord came upon Saul , when he had heard these words , and his anger was exceedingly kindled .
And taking both the oxen , he cut them in pieces , and sent them into all the coasts of Israel , by messengers , saying : Whosoever shall not come forth , and follow Saul and Samuel , so shall it be done to his oxen .
And the fear of the Lord fell upon the people , and they went out as one man .
And he numbered them in <unk> : and there were of the children of Israel three hundred thousand : and of the men of Juda thirty thousand .
And they said to the messengers that came : Thus shall you say to the men of Jabes Galaad : To morrow , when the sun shall be hot , you shall have <unk> .
The messengers therefore came , and told the men of Jabes , and they were glad .
And they said : In the morning we will come out to you : and you shall do what you please with us .
And it came to pass , when the morrow was come , that Saul put the people in three companies : and he came into the midst of the camp in the morning watch , and he slew the Ammonites until the day grew hot , and the rest were scattered , so that two of them were not left together .
And the people said to Samuel : Who is he that said : Shall Saul reign over us ?
Bring the men , and we will kill them .
And Saul said : No man shall be killed this day : because the Lord this day hath wrought salvation in Israel :
And Samuel said to the people : Come , and let us go to Galgal , and let us renew the kingdom there .
And all the people went to Galgal , and there they made Saul king , before the Lord in Galgal , and they sacrificed there victims of peace before the Lord .
And there Saul and all the men of Israel rejoiced exceedingly .
1 Kings Chapter 12 Samuel ’ s <unk> is <unk> .
God sheweth by a sign from heaven that they had done ill in asking for a king .
And Samuel said to all Israel : Behold I have hearkened to your voice in all that you said to me , and have made a king over you .
And now the king goeth before you : but I am old and <unk> : and my sons are with you : having then conversed with you from my youth until this day , behold here I am .
Speak of me before the Lord , and before his anointed , whether I have taken any man ’ s ox , or ass : if I have wronged any man , if I have oppressed any man , if I have taken a <unk> at any man ’ s hand : and I will despise it this day , and will restore it to you .
And they said : Thou hast not wronged us , nor oppressed us , nor taken ought at any man ’ s hand .
And he said to them : The Lord is witness against you , and his anointed is witness this day , that you have not found any thing in my hand .
And they said : He is witness .
And Samuel said to the people : It is the Lord who made Moses and Aaron , and brought our fathers out of the land of Egypt .
Now , therefore , stand up , that I may plead in judgment against you before the Lord , concerning all the kindness of the Lord , which he hath shewn to you , and to your fathers :
How Jacob went into Egypt , and your fathers cried to the Lord : and the Lord sent Moses and Aaron , and brought your fathers out of Egypt , and made them dwell in this place .
And they forgot the Lord their God , and he delivered them into the hands of Sisara , captain of the army of <unk> , and into the hands of the Philistines , and into the hand of the king of Moab , and they fought against them .
But afterwards they cried to the Lord , and said : We have sinned , because we have forsaken the Lord , and have served Baalim and Astaroth : but now deliver us from the hand of our enemies , and we will serve thee .
And the Lord sent Jerobaal , and <unk> , and Jephte , and Samuel , and delivered you from the hand of your enemies round about , and you dwelt securely .
Jerobaal and <unk> .... That is , Gedeon and Samson called here <unk> or <unk> , because he was of Dan .
But seeing that <unk> , king of the children of Ammon , was come against you , you said to me : <unk> , but a king shall reign over us : whereas the Lord your God was your king .
Now , therefore , your king is here , whom you have chosen and desired : Behold the Lord hath given you a king .
If you will fear the Lord , and serve him , and hearken to his voice , and not provoke the mouth of the Lord : then shall both you , and the king who reigneth over you , be followers of the Lord your God .
But if you will not hearken to the voice of the Lord , but will <unk> against his words , the hand of the Lord shall be upon you , and upon your fathers .
Now then stand , and see this great thing which the Lord will do in your sight .
Is it not wheat harvest to day ?
I will call upon the Lord , and he shall send thunder and rain : and you shall know , and see that you yourselves have done a great evil in the sight of the Lord , in desiring a king over you .
<unk> harvest .... At which time of the year , it never thunders or <unk> in those countries .
And Samuel cried unto the Lord , and the Lord sent thunder and rain that day .
And all the people greatly feared the Lord and Samuel .
And all the people said to Samuel : Pray for thy servants to the Lord thy God , that we may not die , for we have added to all our sins this evil , to ask for a king .
And Samuel said to the people : Fear not , you have done all this evil : but yet depart not from following the Lord , but serve the Lord with all your heart .
And turn not aside after vain things , which shall never profit you , nor deliver you , because they are vain .
And the Lord will not forsake his people for his great name ’ s sake : because the Lord hath sworn to make you his people .
And far from me be this sin against the Lord , that I should cease to pray for you : and I will teach you the good and right way .
Therefore fear the Lord , and serve him in truth , and with your whole heart , for you have seen the great works which he hath done among you .
But if you will still do wickedly : both you and your king shall perish together .
1 Kings Chapter 13 The war between Saul and the Philistines .
The distress of the Israelites .
Saul offereth sacrifice before the coming of Samuel : for which he is reproved .
Saul was a child of one year when he began to reign , and he reigned two years over Israel .
Of one year .... That is , he was good and like an innocent child , and for two years continued in that <unk> .
And Saul chose him three thousand men of Israel : and two thousand were with Saul in Machmas , and in mount Bethel : and a thousand with Jonathan in Gabaa of Benjamin : and the rest of the people he sent back every man to their dwellings .
And Jonathan smote the garrison of the Philistines which was in Gabaa .
And when the Philistines had heard of it , Saul sounded the trumpet over all the land , saying : Let the Hebrews hear .
And all Israel heard this report : Saul hath smitten the garrison of the Philistines : and Israel took courage against the Philistines .
And the people were called together after Saul to Galgal .
The Philistines also were assembled to fight against Israel , thirty thousand chariots , and six thousand horsemen , and a multitude of people besides , like the sand on the <unk> for number .
And going up they camped in Machmas , at the east of Bethaven .
And when the men of Israel saw that they were straitened ( for the people were <unk> ) , they hid themselves in <unk> , and in <unk> , and in rocks , and in dens , and in <unk> .
And some of the Hebrews passed over the Jordan into the land of Gad and Galaad .
And when Saul was yet in Galgal , all the people that followed him were greatly afraid .
And he waited seven days , according to the appointment of Samuel , and Samuel came not to Galgal , and the people <unk> away from him .
Then Saul said : Bring me the holocaust , and the peace offerings .
And he offered the holocaust .
And when he had made an end of offering the holocaust , behold Samuel came : and Saul went forth to meet him and salute him .
And Samuel said to him : What hast thou done ?
Saul answered : Because I saw that the people <unk> from me , and thou wast not come according to the days appointed , and the Philistines were gathered together in Machmas ,
I said : Now will the Philistines come down upon me to Galgal , and I have not appeased the face of the Lord .
<unk> by necessity , I offered the holocaust .
And Samuel said to Saul : Thou hast done foolishly , and hast not kept the commandments of the Lord thy God , which he commanded thee .
And if thou hadst not done thus , the Lord would now have established thy kingdom over Israel for ever :
But thy kingdom shall not continue .
The Lord hath sought him a man according to his own heart : and him hath the Lord commanded to be prince over his people , because thou hast not observed that which the Lord commanded .
And Samuel arose and went up from Galgal to Gabaa of Benjamin .
And the rest of the people went up after Saul , to meet the people who fought against them , going from Galgal to Gabaa , in the hill of Benjamin .
And Saul numbered the people , that were found with him , about six hundred men .
And Saul , and Jonathan his son , and the people that were present with them , were in Gabaa of Benjamin : But the Philistines encamped in Machmas .
And there went out of the camp of the Philistines three companies to <unk> .
One company went towards the way of <unk> to the land of <unk> ;
And another went by the way of <unk> , and the third turned to the way of the border , above the valley of <unk> towards the desert .
Now there was no <unk> to be found in all the land of Israel , for the Philistines had taken this <unk> , lest the Hebrews should make them swords or spears .
So all Israel went down to the Philistines , to <unk> every man his <unk> , and his <unk> , and his axe , and his <unk> .
So that their <unk> , and their <unk> , and their <unk> , and their <unk> , were <unk> , even to the <unk> , which was to be <unk> .
And when the day of battle was come , there was neither sword nor spear found in the hand of any of the people that were with Saul and Jonathan , except Saul and Jonathan his son .
And the army of the Philistines went out in order to <unk> further in Machmas .
1 Kings Chapter 14 Jonathan <unk> the Philistines .
